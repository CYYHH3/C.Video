WEBVTT

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.805
[person]
For me, WW is the Super Bowl.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.406
[person]
You can feel the energy.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.208
[person]
It's like really deep insights

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:10.244
of what it feels like
being a developer.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.683
[person]
Really?

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:17.751
[person]
Wow.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.820
[laughs]

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.957
[person]
Okay, we open on black.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.528
The curtain slowly opens.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:30.497
Have a DeLorean on the stage.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.666
Tim Cook gets out
of that DeLorean,

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.103
showing the phone's
flux capacitor.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.906
[person] I would probably
not start there.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.775
I think it's kind of geeky.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:42.943
[person] Cut!

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.278
[person]
Are we going to go again?

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.380
[person] So we open on black.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.448
[person]
Does it have to be black?

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:49.983
[person]
It doesn't have to be black.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:51.151
[both] It could be yellow.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:53.587
[person] Now my mind goes into,
like, a cartoon.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.989
[person] Imagine someone
on their computer,

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:57.391
you know, they have an idea.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.992
And, like, they push,
like, enter,

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:03.163
or some red button
and it goes out to the world.

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:06.266
And then all of a sudden,
there's like millions of people

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.535
around the globe
that get to experience

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.304
the thing that you've made.

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:12.673
Are you actually able
to do all this?

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:13.707
[person] Um...

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.842
[record scratch]

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.111
[person]
Maybe the title of the film

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:21.348
should be
"Our Journey Into Tomorrow."

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.452
I see a little girl
in an endless white room.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.956
She meets Craig Federighi.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:30.591
[Craig] Hi.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:31.859
[person] But we don't see him.

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:33.093
We just hear his voice.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.261
[Craig] Not cool.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.029
[echoing]

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:37.364
[person] Now she's older.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.900
And dressed for work.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.435
[person] There has to be action
at this point

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.769
or, like, some sort of drama.

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:45.672
She goes to work and discovers
something catastrophic.

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:46.940
Someone says...

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:48.909
[person] We have a bug.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.378
[person] So she comes in

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.480
and pounds on the keyboard.

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:56.483
[dramatic music]

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:58.118
And the bug is fixed.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.186
[cheering]

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.787
Yeah, it's like a musical.

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:01.655
[person] Musical?

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.558
[person]
Yeah, The Bug, But A Musical.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.226
[music]

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.165
[music continues]

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:18.205
[music continues]

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:26.880
[person] Wait a minute.

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:30.951
Why not make arena rock of WW?

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.987
[music]

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:41.195
There wouldn't be
any pyro usually.

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:42.429
But I think, why not?

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.064
Pyro is fun.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.069
[person]
Do you think it would work?

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.604
[person] Uh, you won't know
if you don't try.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.607
[music continues]

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.610
[chanting]

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:59.646
[cheering]

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:12.559
[Tim] Good morning.

00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:15.128
And welcome to WWDC.

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:17.531
It's so wonderful to see
so many familiar faces

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.333
with us today.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.402
We're excited to share
our latest technologies with you

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.171
and with the incredible
community

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.341
of millions of Apple developers
around the world.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.710
Your creativity
and groundbreaking apps

00:03:29.743 --> 00:03:32.679
continue to deliver new
and meaningful ways

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.915
to enrich people's lives.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.050
We applaud
the extraordinary work

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:38.118
you've been able to do

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.187
throughout
this challenging time.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.357
Last year's WWDC
was our most inclusive

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.893
and most watched
developer conference ever,

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:48.795
with nearly 25 million viewers.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.598
It was exciting to have
so many people join us

00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:55.035
and to see the impact it had
on new Apple developers

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:58.305
as we broadened our audience,
welcoming more people

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:00.841
from more places
around the world.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:03.877
We've continued to look for ways
to help cultivate

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.979
the next generation
of developers

00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:10.217
with an emphasis on those
underrepresented in technology.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.220
We host entrepreneur camps
for Black and female developers

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.024
to foster the talents
of future industry leaders.

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:20.427
Our Developer Academies,
including the newest in Detroit,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.329
prepare the coders of tomorrow

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.932
with valuable tools
and training.

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:27.868
And Learn to Code offers
an amazing curriculum

00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:31.705
for people to develop new skills
and learn Swift.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.208
We are committed
to being a force for change

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.743
as we seek to make the world
a better place,

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:39.680
full of opportunity
for all of us.

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:43.750
This year, we're bringing you
another online experience

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:46.887
featuring over 200
in-depth sessions,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.156
one-to-one labs
with Apple engineers,

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.591
and so much more.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.392
We'll provide the tools you need

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:55.896
to continue creating the world's
most innovative apps,

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:59.433
apps that inspire us
in new ways every day.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.869
And just like last year's WWDC,

00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:05.706
this entire conference
will be made available for free.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.576
We've got a lot of exciting news
and breakthrough innovations

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.345
to share with you today.

00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:14.314
So let's get started
by turning it over to Craig

00:05:14.348 --> 00:05:17.551
to tell us what's new in iOS.

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:18.685
[Craig] Thanks, Tim.

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.822
All right, let's dive right in.

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:29.530
For many of us, our iPhone
has become indispensable.

00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:32.799
And at the heart of iPhone
is iOS.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:36.403
iOS powers the experiences
we've come to rely on.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:38.472
This year,
we were inspired to create

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:42.376
even more meaningful ways
iPhone could help you.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.012
Our new release is iOS 15.

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:48.048
It's packed with features
that make the iOS experience

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:51.451
adapt to and complement
the way you use iPhone,

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:53.020
whether it's staying connected

00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:55.455
with those
who matter to you most,

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:58.759
finding the space
to focus without distraction,

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.828
using intelligence to discover
the information you need,

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:04.665
or exploring
the world around you.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.000
Let's start off with features
that will let you

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:10.103
stay connected
in brand-new ways.

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:13.106
In a year when figuring out
how to get face-to-face

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.142
has felt more essential
than ever,

00:06:15.175 --> 00:06:17.678
we've all found ourselves
using video calling

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.313
for just about everything,

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:22.316
and when it comes
to making calls that are easy,

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.320
spontaneous, and connect us
with the people who matter most,

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:28.856
FaceTime is a standout.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.058
With its incredibly
intuitive design

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:33.427
and end-to-end encryption
since day one,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.997
FaceTime is how we catch up
with friend around the world

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.601
and how we stay close to family
members when we're apart.

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:42.970
Enjoying these deeply personal
moments over video

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:45.105
can bring so much joy,

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:47.307
but it also has its challenges.

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:49.676
When talking in person,
our brains process

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.280
hundreds of social, auditory
and visual cues.

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:55.082
When talking on a video call,

00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:57.084
many of those signals
can get lost,

00:06:57.117 --> 00:06:59.052
leaving us feeling drained.

00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:02.122
So this year, we've set out
to make FaceTime calls

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:05.893
feel more natural,
comfortable, and lifelike.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:08.929
First is a feature
that makes FaceTime calls

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:12.332
sound like you're sitting
in the very same room.

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:14.501
We're bringing spatial audio
to FaceTime,

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:17.771
creating a sound field
that helps conversations flow

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:20.841
as easily as they do
face-to-face.

00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:23.310
Now your friends' voices
are spread out

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:25.012
to sound like they're coming
from the direction

00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:27.281
in which they're positioned
on the video call,

00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:31.885
making your calls more
comfortable and more natural.

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.489
Next, let's talk about
two powerful new options

00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:37.291
for your microphone.

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:40.060
The first is voice isolation.

00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:41.395
When you're on a FaceTime call,

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:44.198
your mic is picking up
a cacophony of sound,

00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:45.732
so in voice isolation,

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:48.268
machine learning
distinguishes those sounds,

00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:52.606
blocks out the ambient noise,
and prioritizes your voice

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.075
so that it comes through
crystal clear.

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:56.009
Check it out.

00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:57.444
[person]
I wish I could be there!

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.079
[person] Me too!

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:01.014
Let me fix this.

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:03.217
Better, right?

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.218
[person] Yeah.

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:05.752
[person] Got what she wanted
for her birthday.

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:08.822
[Craig] Sometimes, though,

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:11.358
we want every bit of sound
to come through,

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:14.394
and that's when you switch
to wide spectrum.

00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:16.063
In wide spectrum,
your mic picks up

00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:18.332
an entire symphony's worth
of sound:

00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:21.635
your voice
and everything around you.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:25.005
Next, let's turn to video.

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:27.441
When you want to see
every face in the room,

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:28.976
you can now turn on grid view,

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:32.012
giving you another way to view
your group FaceTime calls.

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:35.015
Here, you see people
in the same size tiles,

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:38.018
and you'll be able to clearly
identify who's speaking

00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:40.153
while seeing
everyone else's reactions.

00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:42.289
And to make your FaceTime
video capture

00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:46.894
more beautiful than ever,
we're introducing portrait mode,

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:48.362
where we've taken inspiration

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:50.697
from iPhone's
stunning portrait photos.

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:54.034
In FaceTime, portrait mode
blurs the background

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:57.237
and naturally
puts the focus on you.

00:08:57.271 --> 00:09:00.574
Next, to help you schedule
your FaceTime calls,

00:09:00.607 --> 00:09:03.577
we've created FaceTime links.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.380
Now you can generate a link
for a FaceTime call

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:08.715
and share it anywhere.

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:11.485
It's a terrific way
to plan ahead for a call.

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:15.055
You can send the FaceTime link
in places like Messages, email,

00:09:15.088 --> 00:09:17.658
WhatsApp,
or jump into Calendar

00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:19.326
and make an event
for your FaceTime call

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:22.963
so everyone will know exactly
where to meet and when.

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:25.499
And it's not just Apple devices

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:27.534
that can use a FaceTime link
to join your call.

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:30.404
Your friends with Android
and Windows devices

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:32.439
can use your FaceTime link
to join the call

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:35.976
right from their browser,
and even on the web,

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:38.445
FaceTime calls are still
end-to-end encrypted,

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:41.782
so your privacy
is never compromised.

00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:43.684
Some of our favorite ways
to connect

00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:45.552
involve more than just talking,

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:47.588
like getting together
for a weekly movie night

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.389
or listening to an album
with a friend

00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:52.059
that brings back
amazing memories.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.628
We love enjoying
shared experiences,

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:57.431
and so we built SharePlay.

00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:00.000
SharePlay is a powerful
new set of features

00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:00.000
SharePlay is a powerful
new set of features

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:01.368
for shared experiences

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:04.071
that you can enjoy
when you're on a FaceTime call.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:07.074
With SharePlay, you can
bring music into your call

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:10.577
for a shared listening
experience unlike any other,

00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.246
watch movies and TV shows

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:15.983
while having rich, real-time
connection with your friends.

00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:17.718
And share your screen,

00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:19.453
giving you
limitless possibilities

00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:22.923
for bringing apps
right into your FaceTime calls.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.124
Let me show you how this works,

00:10:24.157 --> 00:10:27.060
starting with
listening together.

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:29.029
Say you're hanging out
on a FaceTime,

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:32.032
talking about a new album
that came out over the weekend.

00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:33.000
With SharePlay,

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.903
you could bring that album
right into the conversation.

00:10:35.936 --> 00:10:38.105
When you're on a call,
all you need to do

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:40.107
is press play in Apple Music,

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.376
and you can choose
to listen together.

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:45.579
And like magic,
high quality music playback

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:48.615
will start in sync
for everyone on the call,

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:50.884
and you're still connected
with FaceTime while listening.

00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:54.721
Everyone on the call
can add songs to a shared queue,

00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:58.659
and shared playback controls
let anyone press play, pause,

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:00.727
or jump to the next track.

00:11:00.761 --> 00:11:04.498
Now let's check out what
it's like to watch together.

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:05.666
When you're on
a FaceTime call,

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:08.569
jump to streaming app
and press play.

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:09.903
and boom,

00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:13.173
you and your friends
are watching the same video

00:11:13.207 --> 00:11:14.341
totally in sync.

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:16.343
SharePlay is unlike
any other

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:18.078
shared content experience
out there

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:21.014
because it moves fluidly
throughout the whole system.

00:11:21.048 --> 00:11:23.584
Maybe you want to order takeout
while you watch.

00:11:23.617 --> 00:11:25.752
Picture in Picture
lets you see your friends

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:28.021
and the video
you're enjoying together,

00:11:28.055 --> 00:11:30.390
and controls
are always accessible

00:11:30.424 --> 00:11:31.625
with just a tap.

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:33.327
And if the group wants
to stay connected

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.429
with no interruptions
to the video's sound,

00:11:35.462 --> 00:11:36.864
you can jump into Messages

00:11:36.897 --> 00:11:39.266
and keep the conversation
going there.

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:41.969
And when the moment calls
for a bigger screen,

00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:44.771
you can extend the video
to your Apple TV

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:46.640
and watch it there
while sharing the moment

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:50.344
with your friends over FaceTime
on your iPhone.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:53.547
Even when you're using SharePlay
across multiple devices,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.916
everyone will remain in sync.

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:58.151
We wanted to make sure
you have a ton

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:00.521
of incredible experiences
to share in FaceTime,

00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:03.423
so in addition to Apple Music
and the TV app,

00:12:03.457 --> 00:12:05.192
SharePlay is designed
to work with

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:08.061
your other favorite apps
and streaming services.

00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:10.864
With an API
built for easy adoption,

00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:14.301
developers can bring their own
apps right into FaceTime.

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:16.270
And today,
we're so pleased to announce

00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:19.840
that we're already working
with some incredible partners.

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:23.043
Watch blockbuster movies
with your friends on Disney+,

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.479
and hit TV shows on Hulu.

00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:27.881
Catch originals from HBO Max.

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:30.083
And see your friends react live
to a buzzer-beater

00:12:30.117 --> 00:12:31.385
in the NBA app.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.320
Or a speed run on Twitch.

00:12:33.353 --> 00:12:36.690
Jump on TikTok to watch
the funniest videos of the week,

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:39.193
learn a new skill with a friend
on MasterClass,

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:41.261
and so much more.

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:44.398
Finally, check out
screen sharing.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:47.000
You can use it
to browse Zillow listings

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:48.902
live with your future roommates

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:51.805
or show off a tricky move
in your favorite game.

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:53.807
Screen sharing
is also a simple

00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:56.076
and super effective way
to help someone out

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:58.245
and answer questions
right in the moment.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.948
And it works across
Apple devices.

00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:05.018
So that's SharePlay,
a whole new way in FaceTime

00:13:05.052 --> 00:13:09.056
to connect and share experiences
with the people you love.

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:12.426
Next, when it comes to staying
connected throughout the day,

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:15.529
our go-to is Messages,

00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:17.865
and these days,
so many of our conversations

00:13:17.898 --> 00:13:21.635
are inspired through sharing
articles, photos, and more.

00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:24.037
So this year,
we're introducing great new ways

00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:27.107
to enjoy all of this amazing
shared content

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.643
and the exchanges that follow.

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:32.379
Here's Mindy to show you
how it all works.

00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:33.814
[Mindy] Thanks, Craig.

00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:36.984
I'm so excited to show
you what's new in Messages.

00:13:37.017 --> 00:13:38.919
Let's check out
my family's conversation.

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:40.354
Everyone's sending me pictures

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:42.623
from our fun trip
down to Joshua Tree.

00:13:42.656 --> 00:13:45.325
Look at this brand-new
collage design.

00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:48.061
And this cool stack with
even more photos from Taylor.

00:13:48.095 --> 00:13:50.631
I can quickly
swipe through them,

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:52.266
tap to view the full bunch,

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:54.935
and add a quick Tapback.

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:57.271
Now, let's see what's going on
with my friends.

00:13:57.304 --> 00:13:59.606
They're always sending me
all kinds of things,

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.209
like this fun playlist from Leah

00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:04.444
and this mission critical
article from Casey

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.780
about what type of pizza
is best.

00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:09.883
The thing is, the time when
I receive this great content

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:12.686
is often different than
when I'm ready to enjoy it.

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:14.988
For example, I'm not going
to read this right now,

00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:18.192
but I'd love to the next time
I catch up on the news.

00:14:18.225 --> 00:14:20.594
Let me show you something
we designed just for that

00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:22.796
called Shared with You.

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:25.132
So now, if I head over
to the News app,

00:14:25.165 --> 00:14:26.700
there's a new
Shared with You section

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:29.169
that conveniently surfaces
that pizza article

00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:31.104
and a few from my other friends.

00:14:31.138 --> 00:14:33.607
Now that I'm ready to learn
more, I can take a look,

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.708
and check this out.

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:36.710
Up top,
it shows me who it's from.

00:14:36.743 --> 00:14:39.780
And I can tap "from Casey"
to pick up our conversation

00:14:39.813 --> 00:14:41.315
and remind her that deep dish

00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:44.084
is obviously
the best kind of pizza,

00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:47.087
and then get right back
to browsing.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.890
So now, if I want to check out
that playlist Leah sent earlier,

00:14:49.923 --> 00:14:51.692
I can head over to Apple Music.

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:53.660
And it's right here.

00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:55.229
Let's take a listen.

00:14:55.262 --> 00:14:58.966
[percussive music]

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:00.167
Love it.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.369
Definitely adding this one
to my library.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.439
Now, one I really love
is photos.

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:06.707
Remember those great pictures

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.109
from my family's trip
to Joshua Tree?

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:11.778
Well, over in the Photos app,
the new Shared with You section

00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:13.914
makes it super easy
to get back to them.

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:16.817
They'll also appear in
my featured photos and memories.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.252
And what's really cool is,

00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:21.054
they're automatically
brought over to my library too.

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:23.257
So if I scroll back
to that Joshua Tree trip,

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.491
and drill in,

00:15:24.525 --> 00:15:26.793
you can see all the great photos
my cousin sent

00:15:26.827 --> 00:15:28.695
are right here
with the ones I took,

00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:32.666
making my collection so much
more complete with zero effort.

00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:34.968
And Photos is smart enough
to only bring over the ones

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:38.105
I actually care about,
like the ones I was there for,

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:39.439
so I don't have to worry

00:15:39.473 --> 00:15:42.176
about screenshots or memes
cluttering up my library.

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:45.245
So that's sharing in iOS 15.

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.713
Back to you, Craig.

00:15:46.747 --> 00:15:49.716
[Craig] In addition to Photos,
Apple Music, and News,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.385
we've built Shared with You

00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:55.889
into Safari, Apple Podcasts,
and the Apple TV app.

00:15:55.923 --> 00:15:58.692
And if something especially
important comes through,

00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:00.060
you can quickly pin it,

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:02.229
and it will be elevated
in Shared with You

00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:03.964
and places like search.

00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:06.934
So that's Messages
with Shared with You,

00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:08.468
bringing connection
to the places

00:16:08.502 --> 00:16:10.637
you love to enjoy content.

00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:12.172
Together with SharePlay

00:16:12.206 --> 00:16:13.974
and other powerful updates
to FaceTime,

00:16:14.007 --> 00:16:16.944
we're giving you even more
meaningful ways to connect.

00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:20.848
Of course, that means
making the time for it,

00:16:20.881 --> 00:16:22.115
so we have new tools

00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:24.818
to help you focus
on what matters most.

00:16:24.852 --> 00:16:28.622
Today, iPhone plays
so many roles in our lives.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:32.092
It's where we get information,
how people reach us,

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:33.961
and where we get things done.

00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:36.797
This is great,
but it means our attention

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.700
is being pulled
in so many different directions,

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:44.805
and finding that balance between
work and life can be tricky.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.107
We want to free up space
to focus

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.309
and help you be in the moment,

00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:52.946
and that starts
with notifications.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.116
They have a fresh new look,
contact photos for people,

00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:57.851
and larger icons for apps,

00:16:57.885 --> 00:17:00.254
making them even easier
to identify.

00:17:00.287 --> 00:17:03.257
Notifications are useful,
though they can pile up

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.591
throughout the course of a day,

00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:06.393
breaking your focus
in those moments

00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:08.495
when you're trying
to get in the zone.

00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:10.764
And the truth is,
while some notifications

00:17:10.797 --> 00:17:12.633
require your
immediate attention,

00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:14.601
others could be
dealt with later.

00:17:14.635 --> 00:17:16.770
To help you engage
on your own time,

00:17:16.803 --> 00:17:19.973
we're introducing
the notification summary,

00:17:20.007 --> 00:17:22.576
a helpful collection
of your notifications

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.445
you can schedule to be delivered
at any time you choose,

00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:27.147
like in the morning and evening.

00:17:27.181 --> 00:17:29.249
We use on-device intelligence

00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:31.051
based on how you interact
with your apps

00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:32.386
to arrange the summary

00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:34.388
so it's easy
to quickly catch up.

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:37.691
Notifications in the summary
are ordered by priority,

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:40.527
with the most relevant ones
rising to the top.

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:43.063
Notifications from people will
not end up in the summary,

00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:46.133
so you won't miss important
messages as they come in.

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:49.002
If now really isn't a good time,

00:17:49.036 --> 00:17:52.639
you can use Do Not Disturb
to silence all notifications.

00:17:52.673 --> 00:17:55.943
And it turns out, it's even
easier to step away and focus

00:17:55.976 --> 00:17:57.411
if people know we're busy,

00:17:57.444 --> 00:17:59.379
so we created an easy way

00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:02.115
to signal to others
when you're doing that.

00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:04.484
Now when you're using
Do Not Disturb,

00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:07.754
your status is automatically
displayed in Messages.

00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:09.089
When you reach out to someone

00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:10.824
who's indicated
they don't want to be disturbed,

00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:13.527
you'll be reminded
in that moment.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.331
And for truly urgent messages,
there's a way to get through.

00:18:17.364 --> 00:18:19.266
While an important part
of finding focus

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:21.735
is about reducing distraction
from others,

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:25.739
it's also about drawing
boundaries for yourself.

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.341
There may be periods in your day

00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:30.110
when you want to be
totally focused on work,

00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:31.712
or maybe you just want
to be fully present

00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:33.780
with your family at dinner.

00:18:33.814 --> 00:18:36.383
In these moments,
you can use Do Not Disturb

00:18:36.416 --> 00:18:40.120
or strike more of a balance
with Focus.

00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:42.656
Focus is a new way
to match your device

00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:44.258
to your current mind-set.

00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:46.460
With Focus, all you have to do

00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:48.795
is choose
what you want to focus on.

00:18:48.829 --> 00:18:50.197
You can carve out time
in your day

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.432
for work or your personal life.

00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:55.469
When setting up a Focus,
we use on-device intelligence

00:18:55.502 --> 00:18:59.406
about your past activity
to suggest the apps and people

00:18:59.439 --> 00:19:01.074
to allow notifications from.

00:19:01.108 --> 00:19:03.110
So if you're at work,
you could choose

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:05.379
to only be notified by coworkers

00:19:05.412 --> 00:19:08.448
or apps like Mail,
Calendar, or Slack.

00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:10.584
You can even dedicate a page
on your home screen

00:19:10.617 --> 00:19:11.752
to match your focus

00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:13.253
and organize your apps
and widgets

00:19:13.287 --> 00:19:15.289
in a way
that reduces temptations

00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:18.025
by making only
your work apps visible.

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:20.894
For personal life, we'll suggest
being notified

00:19:20.928 --> 00:19:24.665
only by friends and family
or apps like Calm.

00:19:24.698 --> 00:19:26.400
And for a home screen to match,

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:29.102
you can have your favorite
entertainment apps like YouTube

00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:31.839
or widgets for keeping up
with your friends and family.

00:19:31.872 --> 00:19:34.675
We'll even intelligently
suggest using a Focus

00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:36.276
based on your context,

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.179
using different signals
like location or time of day.

00:19:39.213 --> 00:19:42.349
Of course, you can create
a custom Focus too.

00:19:42.382 --> 00:19:44.651
And when you use a Focus
on one device,

00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:48.222
it automatically sets
on all your other devices.

00:19:48.255 --> 00:19:50.390
We think together, these tools

00:19:50.424 --> 00:19:53.994
are a really powerful way
to help you find balance.

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:57.030
Not only does iOS
give you space to focus,

00:19:57.064 --> 00:20:01.335
it also uses intelligence
to elevate your experience,

00:19:57.064 --> 00:20:01.335
it also uses intelligence
to elevate your experience,

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.037
helping you discover more
in your photos,

00:20:04.071 --> 00:20:05.839
quickly find
what you're looking for,

00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:08.709
and even relive special moments.

00:20:08.742 --> 00:20:12.813
Let's get started with a feature
we call Live Text.

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:16.950
Today our photos are full
of rich and useful information,

00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:18.752
from photos of places we visit

00:20:18.785 --> 00:20:21.088
to handwritten notes
of family recipes.

00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:24.391
And now Live Text
unlocks this information

00:20:24.424 --> 00:20:26.326
in a way that's really natural.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.428
It starts with the camera.

00:20:28.462 --> 00:20:29.663
Let me show you.

00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:32.332
Let's say I just finished
a meeting with the team,

00:20:32.366 --> 00:20:35.169
and I want to capture my notes
from the whiteboard.

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:38.205
I can now just point the camera
at the whiteboard

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:41.575
and an indicator appears
here in the lower right.

00:20:41.608 --> 00:20:44.411
When I tap it,
the text just jumps right out.

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:47.381
I can use my normal
text selection gestures.

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:49.816
Just drag and copy.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.819
Now I can switch over to Mail
and paste those in

00:20:52.853 --> 00:20:55.556
and then send this off to Tim.

00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:57.491
How cool is that?

00:20:57.524 --> 00:21:02.029
And this is great for photos
already in your photo library.

00:21:02.062 --> 00:21:03.797
Here's a photo of a friend.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.667
You may notice that here at the
top there's some text.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.369
Now, I can just select it,
like this,

00:21:09.403 --> 00:21:11.505
and I have the option to use
Look Up

00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:13.807
to find out more
about this restaurant

00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:16.210
and even look up its location.

00:21:16.243 --> 00:21:18.745
Oh, and here's a picture
from a friend.

00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:21.148
Now, you may notice
here in the background,

00:21:21.181 --> 00:21:22.583
is a phone number.

00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:25.552
I can just zoom in,
and with Live Text,

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:27.554
it's recognized with a link.

00:21:27.588 --> 00:21:30.724
I can just tap it
and give this place a call,

00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:31.959
just like that.

00:21:31.992 --> 00:21:33.460
[person]
Hi, Wanderlust Creamery.

00:21:33.493 --> 00:21:34.661
[Craig] Oh, uh, whoops. Sorry.

00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:37.431
Uh, just applying a deep
neural network here

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:38.298
to a photo of your shop.

00:21:38.332 --> 00:21:40.200
No actual need for ice cream
at this time.

00:21:40.234 --> 00:21:42.603
Uh, gotta drop. Bye.

00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:46.540
Live Text works with photos
across the entire system,

00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:48.709
including screenshots,
Quick Look,

00:21:48.742 --> 00:21:50.978
and even photos on the web.

00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:52.913
And it understands
seven languages,

00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:55.649
including simplified
and traditional Chinese,

00:21:55.682 --> 00:21:59.520
and works across iPhone,
iPad, and Mac.

00:21:59.553 --> 00:22:01.221
And it's not just text.

00:22:01.255 --> 00:22:02.756
You can also look up information

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:05.759
on recognized objects
and scenes.

00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:08.061
Just tap,
and you can look up information,

00:22:08.095 --> 00:22:10.864
like the breed of a dog
or type of a flower.

00:22:10.898 --> 00:22:14.001
And this works for art,
books, nature,

00:22:14.034 --> 00:22:15.903
pets, and landmarks.

00:22:15.936 --> 00:22:18.939
We're also making it easier
to search for your photos

00:22:18.972 --> 00:22:22.075
by adding photos to Spotlight.

00:22:22.109 --> 00:22:23.810
Spotlight is
the universal place

00:22:23.844 --> 00:22:25.579
to start all of your searches.

00:22:25.612 --> 00:22:28.015
Now, with photos search
in Spotlight,

00:22:28.048 --> 00:22:31.485
you can quickly find your photos
right from the home screen.

00:22:31.518 --> 00:22:34.087
Spotlight leverages intelligence
from the Photos app,

00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:37.724
so you can search by people,
scenes, elements in your photos,

00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:40.027
or location,
like San Francisco,

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.495
And leveraging Live Text,

00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:44.464
Spotlight can even find text
in your photos,

00:22:44.498 --> 00:22:46.533
which is great
when you're looking for a photo

00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:50.604
of a recipe, a receipt,
or even a handwritten note.

00:22:50.637 --> 00:22:54.341
We've also added all-new
rich results for contacts.

00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:57.411
You'll have quick access
to call, text,

00:22:57.444 --> 00:22:58.946
FaceTime, or email them

00:22:58.979 --> 00:23:01.281
and Spotlight
intelligently includes

00:23:01.315 --> 00:23:02.716
everything related to them:

00:23:02.749 --> 00:23:05.118
their location,
if shared through Find My,

00:23:05.152 --> 00:23:07.454
recent conversations,
shared photos,

00:23:07.487 --> 00:23:10.791
calendar appointments,
notes, and files.

00:23:10.824 --> 00:23:12.893
And we've added
all-new rich results

00:23:12.926 --> 00:23:17.598
for actors, musicians, TV shows,
and movies as well.

00:23:17.631 --> 00:23:19.900
That's Spotlight.

00:23:19.933 --> 00:23:21.869
Next, let's talk
about how Photos

00:23:21.902 --> 00:23:25.005
uses its deep understanding
of what's in your library

00:23:25.038 --> 00:23:28.609
to enable powerful, emotional
features like Memories.

00:23:28.642 --> 00:23:32.312
Memories intelligently curates
your favorite moments,

00:23:32.346 --> 00:23:34.248
stitching photos
and videos together

00:23:34.281 --> 00:23:35.816
into heartfelt movies.

00:23:35.849 --> 00:23:40.053
To take a closer look
at what's new, here's Chelsea.

00:23:40.087 --> 00:23:41.889
[Chelsea] Thanks, Craig.

00:23:41.922 --> 00:23:44.358
This year we've got the biggest
update ever,

00:23:44.391 --> 00:23:46.994
including bringing Apple Music
into your Memories

00:23:47.027 --> 00:23:48.362
for the first time.

00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:49.897
Let me show you.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.666
Here in the Photos app,
I can tap on the For You tab,

00:23:52.699 --> 00:23:54.902
and my Memories
are right at the top.

00:23:54.935 --> 00:23:57.871
Check out this beautiful
new animated title card.

00:23:57.905 --> 00:24:00.274
Let's watch this one
of my climbing adventures.

00:24:00.307 --> 00:24:02.342
You'll hear a relevant,
personalized song

00:24:02.376 --> 00:24:04.845
from Apple Music
that brings the memory to life.

00:24:04.878 --> 00:24:10.884
[light acoustic music]

00:24:17.658 --> 00:24:19.660
These new memories
are built on the fly.

00:24:19.693 --> 00:24:21.695
They're interactive and alive

00:24:21.728 --> 00:24:23.530
and are paced
to the beat of the music.

00:24:23.564 --> 00:24:25.165
I can tap and hold to pause,

00:24:25.199 --> 00:24:27.134
and the music continues to play.

00:24:27.167 --> 00:24:30.838
When I let go, the pacing
adjusts to get back on beat.

00:24:30.871 --> 00:24:32.439
And to see a photo again,

00:24:32.472 --> 00:24:34.174
all it takes is a swipe.

00:24:34.208 --> 00:24:37.077
To customize my memory,
I'll use a new feature

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.879
called Memory Mixes.

00:24:38.912 --> 00:24:40.848
I can tap
to bring up the controls

00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:42.749
then tap this button to jump in.

00:24:42.783 --> 00:24:45.953
Swiping on this carousel
lets me try out different mixes

00:24:45.986 --> 00:24:48.722
with intelligently chosen songs,
pacing,

00:24:48.755 --> 00:24:49.690
and a look to match.

00:24:49.723 --> 00:24:51.191
[upbeat music]

00:24:51.225 --> 00:24:53.727
[Kacey Musgraves'
"Oh, What a World" playing]

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.796
Notice how the feel
of the memory changed

00:24:55.829 --> 00:24:58.198
with a calmer song,
slower transitions,

00:24:58.232 --> 00:24:59.700
and a black and white look.

00:24:59.733 --> 00:25:01.468
[singing]
It's hard to believe

00:25:01.502 --> 00:25:04.338
[Curtis Harding's
"On and On" playing]

00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:05.772
[singing]
I gotta get into...

00:25:05.806 --> 00:25:08.575
[Chelsea] This faster song
has a more energetic feel.

00:25:08.609 --> 00:25:10.878
And these looks
aren't just filters.

00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:12.412
We analyze each photo

00:25:12.446 --> 00:25:14.515
and apply consistent color
and contrast,

00:25:14.548 --> 00:25:17.317
just like a colorist
at a film studio.

00:25:17.351 --> 00:25:19.720
To check out more
intelligent song suggestions,

00:25:19.753 --> 00:25:21.321
I'll tap on the music button.

00:25:21.355 --> 00:25:22.956
You'll notice
these top suggestions

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.858
are a great fit
for my climbing Memory.

00:25:24.892 --> 00:25:28.228
With tens of millions of songs
in the Apple Music Library,

00:25:28.262 --> 00:25:30.030
experts have curated
sets of songs

00:25:30.063 --> 00:25:31.832
that are combined
with my music tastes

00:25:31.865 --> 00:25:33.734
and the knowledge
of what's in my photos

00:25:33.767 --> 00:25:37.070
to create personalized
recommendations just for me.

00:25:37.104 --> 00:25:38.539
I can search for a specific song

00:25:38.572 --> 00:25:40.374
by tapping
on the magnifying glass,

00:25:40.407 --> 00:25:43.810
but I'm gonna go with something
from my listening history.

00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:46.446
This song from Imagine Dragons
will be perfect.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.782
[singing] 'Cause I'm on top
of the world, hey

00:25:48.815 --> 00:25:51.151
I'm on top of the world, hey

00:25:51.185 --> 00:25:53.387
Waiting on this for a while now

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.023
Paying my dues to the dirt

00:25:56.056 --> 00:25:58.792
I'm on top of the world.

00:25:58.825 --> 00:26:01.261
And I can keep watching
related memories,

00:26:01.295 --> 00:26:04.831
personalized with my favorite
songs from Apple Music.

00:26:04.865 --> 00:26:06.366
And now back to Craig.

00:26:07.167 --> 00:26:11.371
[Craig] With Live Text, Look up,
Spotlight, and Memories,

00:26:11.405 --> 00:26:13.974
iOS 15 elevates
the iPhone experience

00:26:14.007 --> 00:26:15.909
with on-device intelligence.

00:26:15.943 --> 00:26:19.646
Next, let's talk about how iOS
helps you better understand

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.548
and explore
the world around you,

00:26:21.582 --> 00:26:25.519
with some great updates
to Wallet, Weather, and Maps.

00:26:25.552 --> 00:26:29.056
To tell us about what's new
in Wallet, here's Jennifer.

00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:31.658
[Jennifer] With the Apple Wallet
app,

00:26:31.692 --> 00:26:34.528
we set out to replace
your physical Wallet.

00:26:34.561 --> 00:26:36.330
Starting with Apple Pay,

00:26:36.363 --> 00:26:40.133
we added payment cards to make
payments safer and more secure.

00:26:40.167 --> 00:26:42.870
Next, we brought transit cards
with Express Mode

00:26:42.903 --> 00:26:44.004
to your iPhone.

00:26:44.037 --> 00:26:46.406
You just breeze through
the turnstiles in San Francisco,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.177
New York, Beijing,
Tokyo, and more.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.412
And just recently,
Walt Disney World

00:26:52.446 --> 00:26:55.549
added their park passes,
creating magical moments

00:26:55.582 --> 00:26:58.285
as you tap to enter,
ride, and explore.

00:26:58.318 --> 00:27:00.554
You can never leave home
without your keys,

00:27:00.587 --> 00:27:03.223
so we're continuing to add keys
to Wallet

00:27:03.257 --> 00:27:05.626
and making them even better.

00:27:05.659 --> 00:27:07.461
We started with car keys,

00:27:07.494 --> 00:27:10.097
which we're improving
with Ultra-Wideband support

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.332
for an unlock and drive
experience.

00:27:12.766 --> 00:27:15.602
No need to take your iPhone
out of your bag or pocket.

00:27:16.436 --> 00:27:19.673
BMW and others will ship cars
with UWBs

00:27:19.706 --> 00:27:21.208
starting later this year.

00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:25.145
With iOS 15, we're bringing keys
for your everyday places

00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:27.848
to Wallet,
starting with where you live.

00:27:27.881 --> 00:27:30.117
We're creating the fastest,
most secure way

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.153
to unlock your house,
apartment, or flat,

00:27:33.187 --> 00:27:34.288
and where you work.

00:27:34.321 --> 00:27:35.923
Just add your corporate badge

00:27:35.956 --> 00:27:38.425
and tap to enter your building
or office.

00:27:38.458 --> 00:27:41.428
And where you travel,
with hotel keys.

00:27:41.461 --> 00:27:42.996
You'll automatically
receive your key

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.131
when your room is ready,

00:27:44.164 --> 00:27:46.700
even before you arrive
at the hotel.

00:27:46.733 --> 00:27:50.404
Starting this fall, Hyatt hotels
will start rolling this out

00:27:50.437 --> 00:27:53.006
to over 1,000 properties
worldwide,

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.443
creating a faster and safer
experience for their guests.

00:27:56.476 --> 00:27:59.513
Anywhere you go,
just tap to unlock.

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:03.050
An incredible range of partners
for locks and access systems

00:28:03.083 --> 00:28:06.920
have signed on to support keys
for all the places you go.

00:28:06.954 --> 00:28:10.424
However, to be fully free
of your physical wallet,

00:28:10.457 --> 00:28:13.660
there's one more thing
we need to bring to iPhone,

00:28:13.694 --> 00:28:15.262
and that's your ID.

00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:18.165
So we're bringing
identity cards to Apple Wallet.

00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:21.401
This fall, you'll just scan
your driver's license

00:28:21.435 --> 00:28:24.104
or state ID in participating
US states.

00:28:24.137 --> 00:28:25.873
It's that easy.

00:28:25.906 --> 00:28:28.775
Your ID information
is now in Wallet,

00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:31.645
encrypted and safely stored
in the Secure Element,

00:28:31.678 --> 00:28:33.680
the same hardware technology

00:28:33.714 --> 00:28:37.084
that makes Apple Pay
private and secure.

00:28:37.117 --> 00:28:40.888
And the TSA is working to enable
airport security checkpoints

00:28:40.921 --> 00:28:44.424
as the first place
you can use your digital ID.

00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:46.326
When you present your ID,

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.929
you'll know what specific
information is requested

00:28:48.962 --> 00:28:50.364
and securely presented.

00:28:50.397 --> 00:28:53.367
With just a tap,
you're off to your flight.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.570
So that's Wallet on your
iPhone and Apple Watch.

00:28:56.603 --> 00:28:57.671
Back to you, Craig.

00:28:57.704 --> 00:29:00.541
[Craig] Next up, weather.

00:29:00.574 --> 00:29:02.609
The Weather app
is incredibly popular,

00:29:02.643 --> 00:29:04.545
and it's getting a huge update.

00:29:04.578 --> 00:29:07.881
First, we're introducing
a beautiful new design

00:29:07.915 --> 00:29:10.784
with data and layouts
that change based on conditions

00:29:10.817 --> 00:29:14.288
such as wind and rain,
unhealthy air quality,

00:29:14.321 --> 00:29:15.622
or sunny skies.

00:29:15.656 --> 00:29:18.125
We've also added
new weather graphics

00:29:18.158 --> 00:29:20.294
to help users
better understand conditions

00:29:20.327 --> 00:29:23.697
like wind, UV index,
and barometric pressure.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.632
And we've completely redesigned

00:29:25.666 --> 00:29:27.935
the gorgeous
animated backgrounds.

00:29:27.968 --> 00:29:30.070
There are now
thousands of variations

00:29:30.103 --> 00:29:31.605
that more accurately represent

00:29:31.638 --> 00:29:34.541
the sun position, clouds,
and precipitation.

00:29:34.575 --> 00:29:36.643
And Weather app in iOS 15

00:29:36.677 --> 00:29:39.980
includes full-screen,
high-resolution weather maps.

00:29:40.013 --> 00:29:41.715
These maps show temperature,

00:29:41.748 --> 00:29:44.685
animated precipitation,
and air quality

00:29:44.718 --> 00:29:47.321
that provide a whole new way
to see the weather around you.

00:29:47.354 --> 00:29:50.224
Next, we have some
really big updates

00:29:50.257 --> 00:29:53.460
for another app our users
depend on every day.

00:29:53.493 --> 00:29:55.195
Apple Maps.

00:29:55.229 --> 00:29:58.265
Apple Maps is the best way
to navigate your world.

00:29:58.298 --> 00:30:00.801
It's easy to use
and beautifully designed,

00:29:58.298 --> 00:30:00.801
It's easy to use
and beautifully designed,

00:30:00.834 --> 00:30:04.705
while providing the confidence
that your privacy is protected.

00:30:04.738 --> 00:30:07.007
Here's Meg to tell you more.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.117
[Meg] Two years ago, we started
rolling out our new map,

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:20.320
offering richer details
and more accurate navigation

00:30:20.354 --> 00:30:22.256
to help you get around.

00:30:22.289 --> 00:30:24.958
Built from the ground up,
we've launched our new map

00:30:24.992 --> 00:30:28.629
so far in the U.S.,
UK, Ireland, and Canada,

00:30:28.662 --> 00:30:30.497
and we're excited to announce

00:30:30.531 --> 00:30:33.467
we're bringing the new map today
to Spain and Portugal,

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.068
and later this year,

00:30:35.102 --> 00:30:37.237
we'll add Italy and Australia.

00:30:37.271 --> 00:30:41.875
Our goal has always been
to build the world's best map.

00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:44.344
So we looked at everything
we've done so far,

00:30:44.378 --> 00:30:47.981
and we asked ourselves, "How can
we push things even further?"

00:30:48.015 --> 00:30:51.518
We started by building
a gorgeous, interactive globe

00:30:51.552 --> 00:30:54.521
that invites users
to tap and explore.

00:30:54.555 --> 00:30:57.558
This is a whole new way
of looking at the world.

00:30:57.591 --> 00:30:58.959
But it's in cities

00:30:58.992 --> 00:31:02.062
where we're taking Apple Maps
to an entirely new level.

00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:05.999
Our current map is great,
and our users have told us

00:31:06.033 --> 00:31:09.236
it's a lot more useful
for navigation and exploration,

00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:13.807
but in iOS 15, Maps will offer
incredible new details

00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:17.511
for commercial districts,
marinas, buildings,

00:31:17.544 --> 00:31:19.146
and so much more.

00:31:19.179 --> 00:31:22.115
We've added things
like elevation,

00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:23.951
new road colors and labels,

00:31:23.984 --> 00:31:26.954
as well as hundreds
of custom-designed landmarks

00:31:26.987 --> 00:31:31.692
for places like Coit Tower
and the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:31:31.725 --> 00:31:34.628
And we built
a beautiful new nighttime mode

00:31:34.661 --> 00:31:36.363
with a moonlit glow.

00:31:36.396 --> 00:31:38.298
We think all of these
improvements

00:31:38.332 --> 00:31:40.000
are going to make
exploring a city

00:31:40.033 --> 00:31:42.302
so much fun for Maps users.

00:31:43.036 --> 00:31:45.439
And when a user is ready
to go somewhere,

00:31:45.472 --> 00:31:50.043
Maps in iOS 15 will make
getting there way better.

00:31:50.077 --> 00:31:51.678
Let's start with driving.

00:31:51.712 --> 00:31:55.482
We've added a great deal
of new road details to the map

00:31:55.516 --> 00:31:58.685
so we can help drivers
as they move throughout a city,

00:31:58.719 --> 00:32:01.822
to better see and understand
important things

00:32:01.855 --> 00:32:07.361
like turn lanes, medians,
bus and taxi lanes, and more.

00:32:07.394 --> 00:32:10.097
This outstanding
attention to detail,

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:14.001
including the addition
of crosswalks and bike lanes,

00:32:14.034 --> 00:32:18.338
will help drivers more safely
navigate complex intersections.

00:32:18.372 --> 00:32:21.441
And when driving on highways,
Maps now renders

00:32:21.475 --> 00:32:23.877
overlapping,
complex interchanges

00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:25.946
in three-dimensional space,

00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:29.917
making it much easier to see
upcoming traffic conditions

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.419
or to know which lane
you need to be in.

00:32:32.452 --> 00:32:34.988
And of course, we'll be bringing
this driving experience

00:32:35.022 --> 00:32:38.659
to CarPlay later this year.

00:32:38.692 --> 00:32:40.761
But it's not just driving.

00:32:40.794 --> 00:32:43.997
We've also made big improvements
for transit riders

00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:47.367
by helping them
easily find nearby stations.

00:32:47.401 --> 00:32:50.170
Users can pin their
favorite lines to the top

00:32:50.204 --> 00:32:52.306
and even keep track
on their Apple Watch

00:32:52.339 --> 00:32:55.976
so there's no need to take your
phone out of your pocket.

00:32:56.009 --> 00:32:59.346
Maps also automatically follows
your transit route,

00:32:59.379 --> 00:33:01.448
notifying you
it's time to disembark

00:33:01.481 --> 00:33:03.584
as you approach
your final destination.

00:33:03.617 --> 00:33:05.919
And if you've ever
exited a station,

00:33:05.953 --> 00:33:08.255
unsure of which direction
you need to go,

00:33:08.288 --> 00:33:11.091
Maps will help
get you back on track.

00:33:11.124 --> 00:33:14.628
Simply hold up your iPhone,
scan the buildings in the area,

00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:17.164
and Maps will generate
a highly accurate position,

00:33:17.197 --> 00:33:20.901
delivering detailed directions
in augmented reality

00:33:20.934 --> 00:33:22.903
to help you complete
your journey.

00:33:22.936 --> 00:33:26.907
We're launching this beautiful
new three-dimensional experience

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.244
in these cities
by the end of 2021,

00:33:30.277 --> 00:33:32.613
with many more to come
next year.

00:33:32.646 --> 00:33:35.616
And that's the all-new
Apple Maps.

00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:37.784
Back to you, Craig.

00:33:37.818 --> 00:33:40.988
[Craig] So that's just some
of what's new in Apple Maps.

00:33:41.021 --> 00:33:44.091
An incredible new way to explore
the natural beauty of the world,

00:33:44.124 --> 00:33:46.193
and an amazing new
three-dimensional

00:33:46.226 --> 00:33:49.296
city experience
with improved navigation.

00:33:49.329 --> 00:33:53.500
iOS 15 is a great release
that helps you stay connected,

00:33:53.534 --> 00:33:57.638
find focus, discover more with
on-device-intelligence,

00:33:57.671 --> 00:33:59.139
and explore the world.

00:33:59.173 --> 00:34:02.509
And there's more, including
Voice Search in Safari,

00:34:02.543 --> 00:34:04.878
powerful support
for cross-app drag and drop,

00:34:04.912 --> 00:34:07.648
and new outfit options
for Memoji.

00:34:07.681 --> 00:34:09.917
So that's iOS 15,

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.020
with powerful new features
that enhance how you use iPhone.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.455
And of course,
one of the most popular

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:18.859
accessories for iPhone
is AirPods.

00:34:18.892 --> 00:34:22.362

what's new, here's Gagan.

to our devices, or to our
favorite entertainment.

00:34:43.951 --> 00:34:48.388
With iOS 15, we have some great
new features coming to AirPods,

00:34:48.422 --> 00:34:50.290
starting
with Conversation Boost,

00:34:50.324 --> 00:34:53.026
which is designed to help people
with mild hearing challenges

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.629
stay more connected
in conversations.

00:34:55.662 --> 00:34:58.465
Through computational audio
and beamforming microphones,

00:34:58.498 --> 00:35:01.068
Conversation Boost
focuses your AirPods Pro

00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.803
on the person
talking in front of you,

00:35:02.836 --> 00:35:05.072
making it easier to hear
and follow along

00:35:05.105 --> 00:35:07.140
in a face-to-face conversation.

00:35:07.174 --> 00:35:09.543
And to help you hear
the conversation even better,

00:35:09.576 --> 00:35:12.779
you can also reduce the amount
of ambient noise.

00:35:12.813 --> 00:35:15.349
Next, when you can't reach
for your iPhone,

00:35:15.382 --> 00:35:18.352
Announce Messages with Siri
helps you stay connected.

00:35:18.385 --> 00:35:22.189
iOS 15 takes this further
with Announce Notifications.

00:35:22.222 --> 00:35:23.991
Now Siri can automatically read

00:35:24.024 --> 00:35:26.727
your important, time-sensitive
notifications to you,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.029
like when your dinner
has been delivered.

00:35:29.062 --> 00:35:31.431
And when you set a location
for your Reminder,

00:35:31.465 --> 00:35:32.733
like the grocery store,

00:35:32.766 --> 00:35:34.334
Siri will read your shopping
list to you

00:35:34.368 --> 00:35:35.669
right when you need it.

00:35:35.702 --> 00:35:37.804
You can easily choose
which Apps to enable

00:35:37.838 --> 00:35:39.173
and select Do Not Disturb

00:35:39.206 --> 00:35:40.440
when you don't want
to be interrupted.

00:35:40.474 --> 00:35:42.209
And if you're using
the new Focus feature,

00:35:42.242 --> 00:35:46.146
your notification preferences
are already taken into account.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.182
Next, we have
significantly improved

00:35:48.215 --> 00:35:50.184
how AirPods work in Find My.

00:35:50.617 --> 00:35:54.121
With iOS 15, you can locate your
AirPods Pro and AirPods Max

00:35:54.154 --> 00:35:55.856
using the Find My network.

00:35:55.889 --> 00:35:58.358
Your AirPods simply send out
a secure Bluetooth beacon

00:35:58.392 --> 00:36:01.161
that can be detected
by other Apple devices.

00:36:01.195 --> 00:36:03.964
They can relay your AirPods'
location to the network

00:36:03.997 --> 00:36:05.299
and then back
to your Find My app.

00:36:05.832 --> 00:36:07.935
And if they're nearby,
just choose Play Sound.

00:36:08.435 --> 00:36:11.505
Listen for the chirp, whether
they're in their case or out.

00:36:11.538 --> 00:36:13.006
[chirping]

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.842
And the new proximity view
in the Find My app

00:36:14.875 --> 00:36:16.810
lets you know
when you're getting close.

00:36:16.844 --> 00:36:18.178
[chime]

00:36:18.212 --> 00:36:20.614
To make it even less likely
to lose your AirPods,

00:36:20.647 --> 00:36:22.683
you can now receive
a Separation Alert

00:36:22.716 --> 00:36:24.751
to notify you if you leave
your AirPods behind.

00:36:25.919 --> 00:36:28.422
Finally, last year,
we introduced spatial audio

00:36:28.455 --> 00:36:31.058
with dynamic head tracking
for AirPods Pro

00:36:31.425 --> 00:36:33.360
and then elevated the experience
even further

00:36:33.393 --> 00:36:35.495
with the high fidelity audio
of AirPods Max.

00:36:36.797 --> 00:36:38.732
Enabled by computational audio,

00:36:38.765 --> 00:36:40.901
the three-dimensional
theater-like sound

00:36:40.934 --> 00:36:42.703
really makes movies
come to life.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:47.474
This fall, we're excited
to extend spatial audio to tvOS.

00:36:47.508 --> 00:36:50.043
So now you can enjoy the full
surround experience,

00:36:50.077 --> 00:36:51.845
tuned for the big screen
in your living room,

00:36:51.879 --> 00:36:54.147
without disturbing
the rest of the house.

00:36:54.181 --> 00:36:55.649
And with dynamic head tracking,

00:36:55.682 --> 00:36:58.252
it properly responds
as you move about the room.

00:36:58.285 --> 00:37:01.121
We're also bringing spatial
audio with dynamic head tracking

00:37:01.154 --> 00:37:03.891
to macOS on our new
M1 powered Macs

00:37:03.924 --> 00:37:08.095
so you can enjoy spatial
on all of your devices.

00:37:08.128 --> 00:37:10.764
In addition, we recently
announced spatial audio

00:37:10.797 --> 00:37:12.299
for Apple Music
with the incredible

00:37:12.332 --> 00:37:15.502
multi-dimensional sound
experience of Dolby Atmos.

00:37:15.536 --> 00:37:18.305
And we're excited that
it's available starting today

00:37:18.338 --> 00:37:20.307
with albums from some
of your favorite artists,

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:25.312
like Ariana Grande, The Weeknd,
J Balvin, and Kacey Musgraves.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.782
With the benefits
of Conversation Boost,

00:37:28.815 --> 00:37:30.484
the convenience of Find My,

00:37:30.517 --> 00:37:32.886
and the enhanced experience
with spatial audio,

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.488
there are some great
new features

00:37:34.521 --> 00:37:35.989
coming to the AirPods family.

00:37:36.557 --> 00:37:38.458
Now back to you, Craig.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:44.097
[singer] ♪ Just like magic,
oh, yeah ♪

00:37:44.131 --> 00:37:47.634
[Craig] It's time to talk about
iPadOS.

00:37:47.668 --> 00:37:50.070
iPad is an incredibly
versatile device,

00:37:50.103 --> 00:37:52.105
with its unique blend
of mobility,

00:37:52.139 --> 00:37:56.143
innovative technologies,
and touch-first user experience,

00:37:56.176 --> 00:37:59.880
and this experience
is powered by iPadOS.

00:37:59.913 --> 00:38:03.083
With iPadOS,
we build distinct capabilities

00:38:03.116 --> 00:38:04.685
that make it possible for iPad

00:38:04.718 --> 00:38:06.920
to become whatever
you need it to be,

00:38:06.954 --> 00:38:08.789
like when you're browsing
your photos

00:38:08.822 --> 00:38:11.892
and iPad becomes an album
of your most precious memories,

00:38:11.925 --> 00:38:13.527
held right in your hands;

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.062
or when you pick up
Apple Pencil

00:38:15.095 --> 00:38:17.898
and it becomes your notepad,
a markup tool,

00:38:17.931 --> 00:38:19.800
or a canvas for new artwork;

00:38:19.833 --> 00:38:22.135
or when you attach
a keyboard and trackpad,

00:38:22.169 --> 00:38:24.104
and it becomes
a powerful new way

00:38:24.137 --> 00:38:26.306
to work on your most important
documents.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.208
This unique set of capabilities

00:38:28.242 --> 00:38:30.811
mean you get things done
right in the moment

00:38:30.844 --> 00:38:32.045
and can seamlessly move

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:34.481
from capturing
and working on your ideas

00:38:34.515 --> 00:38:35.516
to sharing them.

00:38:35.883 --> 00:38:37.584
With iPadOS 15,

00:38:37.618 --> 00:38:40.220
we're taking
this versatility further,

00:38:40.254 --> 00:38:44.057
making iPad even more capable
and more intuitive,

00:38:44.091 --> 00:38:47.794
and we started right
on the home screen with widgets.

00:38:47.828 --> 00:38:50.464
They offer beautiful,
glance-able information

00:38:50.497 --> 00:38:51.865
at just the right moments,

00:38:51.899 --> 00:38:54.968
and this year,
we have a big update.

00:38:55.002 --> 00:38:56.403
Now you can freely place widgets

00:38:56.436 --> 00:38:58.338
among the apps
on your home screen.

00:38:58.372 --> 00:38:59.973
This is a huge deal!

00:39:00.007 --> 00:39:02.142
Let me show you how it works.

00:39:02.176 --> 00:39:03.510
Okay.

00:39:03.544 --> 00:39:05.879
Here I am on the home screen.

00:39:05.913 --> 00:39:07.848
You can see that I already have
a few widgets

00:39:07.881 --> 00:39:09.216
placed along the top.

00:39:09.249 --> 00:39:11.752
Let's start by adding a widget.

00:39:11.785 --> 00:39:14.555
I'll bring up
the widget gallery.

00:39:14.588 --> 00:39:16.356
Here you'll notice
some new widgets

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.325
like the beautiful new
Find My widget

00:39:18.358 --> 00:39:19.526
and the Contacts widget

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.295
which helps you reach family
and friends

00:39:21.328 --> 00:39:22.863
with just a tap.

00:39:22.896 --> 00:39:26.433
Let's find a good spot for this,
towards the top here.

00:39:26.466 --> 00:39:30.037
Now, I'll go back to the gallery
and grab the Parcel widget

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.005
for tracking
my incoming packages

00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:33.373
right on the home screen.

00:39:33.407 --> 00:39:35.409
Perfect.

00:39:35.442 --> 00:39:39.246
Now, of course a bigger canvas
means more room for widgets,

00:39:39.279 --> 00:39:42.182
so we're adding a new,
larger format for widgets

00:39:42.216 --> 00:39:44.751
designed just for iPad's
larger display.

00:39:44.785 --> 00:39:46.720
Here's the new
Apple TV widget.

00:39:46.753 --> 00:39:49.389
I can easily dive into
my favorite shows with a tap,

00:39:49.423 --> 00:39:52.025
and here's my gaming page.

00:39:52.059 --> 00:39:53.460
The new Game Center widget

00:39:53.493 --> 00:39:55.295
lets me jump
into my games faster

00:39:55.329 --> 00:39:57.631
and discover what to play
with friends.

00:39:57.664 --> 00:40:00.133
And check out the new
large-size Photos widget.

00:39:57.664 --> 00:40:00.133
And check out the new
large-size Photos widget.

00:40:00.167 --> 00:40:04.304
It really puts my favorite
photos front and center,

00:40:04.338 --> 00:40:06.306
and with this larger
Files widget,

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.976
I can keep tabs
on all of my work projects.

00:40:09.009 --> 00:40:11.512
Now, with pages full of
these great widgets,

00:40:11.545 --> 00:40:13.547
some of my less frequently used
apps

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.849
have gotten pushed
to later pages.

00:40:15.883 --> 00:40:19.486
We wanted to make it easier
to get to all of your apps,

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.056
so we brought App Library
to iPad.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.992
You can see all my apps
are here,

00:40:25.025 --> 00:40:26.727
automatically categorized
for me.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.464
And what's really cool is we
built access to App Library

00:40:30.497 --> 00:40:31.832
right into the Dock,

00:40:31.865 --> 00:40:33.667
no matter where you are,

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.603
you can always get to your apps.

00:40:36.637 --> 00:40:38.539
And now that you have
App Library,

00:40:38.572 --> 00:40:42.543
you can hide pages
that you no longer need...

00:40:42.576 --> 00:40:45.412
just like this.

00:40:45.445 --> 00:40:49.383
And even reorder them
right from here.

00:40:49.416 --> 00:40:52.085
That's widgets and App Library.

00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:54.121
We think this is going to change
how you get information

00:40:54.154 --> 00:40:57.291
and access all your apps
on iPad.

00:40:57.324 --> 00:40:59.226
We also have a major update

00:40:59.259 --> 00:41:02.129
for another key part
of the iPadOS experience:

00:41:02.162 --> 00:41:03.931
multitasking.

00:41:03.964 --> 00:41:06.433
This year, we've made it
easier to discover,

00:41:06.466 --> 00:41:09.603
easier to use,
and even more powerful.

00:41:09.636 --> 00:41:12.439
To give you a closer look,
here's Shubham.

00:41:12.472 --> 00:41:13.574
[Shubham] Thanks, Craig.

00:41:13.607 --> 00:41:16.543
In iPadOS 15,
there's a new control

00:41:16.577 --> 00:41:18.345
that appears
at the top of your apps.

00:41:19.246 --> 00:41:22.082
Tapping on it reveals
the multitasking menu.

00:41:22.115 --> 00:41:24.618
From here, I can take an app,
full-screen,

00:41:24.651 --> 00:41:27.020
or work with two apps
at the same time

00:41:27.054 --> 00:41:28.856
by creating a Split View
or Slide Over.

00:41:28.889 --> 00:41:31.425
I'll tap on the Split View icon,

00:41:31.458 --> 00:41:33.293
and the app slides
to the edge of the screen,

00:41:33.327 --> 00:41:35.696
giving me quick access
to my home screen,

00:41:35.729 --> 00:41:37.564
where I can easily select
from any of my apps.

00:41:37.598 --> 00:41:41.134
I've been working on a podcast,
so I'll choose Ferrite.

00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:43.604
And now I can work
with Ferrite and Notes

00:41:43.637 --> 00:41:45.072
at the same time in Split View.

00:41:45.105 --> 00:41:48.375
It's also really easy
to switch apps in Split View.

00:41:48.408 --> 00:41:51.445
If I want to replace Ferrite,
I just swipe down,

00:41:51.478 --> 00:41:52.946
and Notes moves aside,

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.215
letting me pick another app
from the home screen.

00:41:55.249 --> 00:41:57.050
Let's select Mail.

00:41:58.318 --> 00:41:59.953
This works exactly the same way

00:41:59.987 --> 00:42:02.155
to choose a new app
from either side of the screen.

00:42:02.189 --> 00:42:04.625
And we brought the same
ease of multitasking

00:42:04.658 --> 00:42:06.693
to apps with multiple windows.

00:42:06.727 --> 00:42:09.930
In Mail, I can touch and hold
on this message

00:42:09.963 --> 00:42:12.599
to open it
centered on my screen.

00:42:12.633 --> 00:42:14.968
This allows me to read
the entire email

00:42:15.002 --> 00:42:17.371
without leaving my current view.

00:42:17.404 --> 00:42:20.374
And I have the same
multitasking controls here, too,

00:42:20.407 --> 00:42:23.510
so I can easily move this
into Split View or Slide Over.

00:42:23.544 --> 00:42:26.713
But I want to save this email
and come back to it later.

00:42:26.747 --> 00:42:29.850
So I can just swipe down
to minimize it

00:42:29.883 --> 00:42:32.019
into a new area
we're calling the Shelf.

00:42:32.052 --> 00:42:35.756
The Shelf gives me easy access
to all open windows of an app.

00:42:35.789 --> 00:42:38.158
Let's go to Safari,
and you'll see that

00:42:38.192 --> 00:42:41.028
the Shelf appears automatically
when I switch apps.

00:42:41.061 --> 00:42:43.730
I often have a lot
of Safari windows open,

00:42:43.764 --> 00:42:46.033
many in Split View
paired with other apps,

00:42:46.066 --> 00:42:49.536
and now I can just tap
to quickly switch between them.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:53.774
I can also add or remove windows
right here from the Shelf.

00:42:53.807 --> 00:42:56.610
We've also made the App Switcher
even more powerful.

00:42:56.643 --> 00:42:58.412
I can now create a Split view

00:42:58.445 --> 00:43:01.682
just by dragging one app
over another.

00:43:01.715 --> 00:43:04.585
So that's multitasking
in iPadOS 15.

00:43:04.618 --> 00:43:06.553
Now back to you, Craig.

00:43:06.587 --> 00:43:08.555
[Craig] Thanks, Shubham.

00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:10.190
These new multitasking features

00:43:10.224 --> 00:43:12.059
will help our users
be more productive

00:43:12.092 --> 00:43:14.728
and do even more on their iPad,

00:43:14.761 --> 00:43:16.063
and what's really cool

00:43:16.096 --> 00:43:18.999
is we now have a new set
of keyboard shortcuts

00:43:19.032 --> 00:43:22.703
that let you do all of this
without lifting a finger.

00:43:22.736 --> 00:43:26.106
iPadOS 15 also gives you
more powerful ways

00:43:26.139 --> 00:43:29.843
to capture and organize
your information with Notes.

00:43:29.877 --> 00:43:32.246
This year we're adding
powerful new features

00:43:32.279 --> 00:43:34.815
for collaboration
and organization.

00:43:34.848 --> 00:43:37.518
First, we're adding mentions.

00:43:37.551 --> 00:43:39.353
Just mention someone
in a shared note

00:43:39.386 --> 00:43:42.189
and they'll get a notification
linking them back.

00:43:42.222 --> 00:43:44.691
There's also an all-new
Activity View

00:43:44.725 --> 00:43:46.226
that quickly shows you
what's changed

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.128
in a shared note
while you were away.

00:43:48.161 --> 00:43:51.198
And to give users new ways
to organize their notes,

00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:53.066
we're adding tags.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.235
You can add a tag
anywhere in your note

00:43:55.269 --> 00:43:58.539
then use the new Tag Browser
to quickly find your notes.

00:43:58.572 --> 00:44:01.909
But sometimes you just want
to quickly jot down a note

00:44:01.942 --> 00:44:04.077
to remember
something important for later,

00:44:04.111 --> 00:44:06.847
and that's why
we're taking Notes system-wide

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.716
with a feature
we call Quick Note.

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:12.319
Quick Note is a fast and easy
way to get to a note,

00:44:12.352 --> 00:44:13.887
no matter what you're doing.

00:44:13.921 --> 00:44:15.889
Here's Will to show you
how it works.

00:44:16.423 --> 00:44:17.524
[Will] Thanks, Craig.

00:44:17.558 --> 00:44:19.693
Starting a Quick Note is easy.

00:44:19.726 --> 00:44:21.895
When I swipe,
the note appears

00:44:21.929 --> 00:44:23.497
out of the corner of the screen.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.232
Now that I've started a note,

00:44:25.265 --> 00:44:28.135
I can type or write
with Apple Pencil.

00:44:28.168 --> 00:44:31.772
It's perfect for jotting down
something like a phone number.

00:44:31.805 --> 00:44:35.909
And when I'm done,
I just swipe it away.

00:44:35.943 --> 00:44:38.212
Let's open Safari.

00:44:38.245 --> 00:44:40.314
What's super cool
about Quick Note

00:44:40.347 --> 00:44:42.850
is that it's aware
of the app I'm using.

00:44:42.883 --> 00:44:46.053
I'll start a new Quick Note
on top of Safari...

00:44:49.356 --> 00:44:52.526
...and now I can easily add
a link from the website

00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:54.361
into my Quick Note.

00:44:54.394 --> 00:44:57.831
I can tap this link anytime
to return to this exact site.

00:44:57.865 --> 00:45:00.968
Let's go to a website
I added a link to earlier.

00:45:01.001 --> 00:45:03.470
A small thumbnail
pops up in the corner

00:45:03.504 --> 00:45:06.640
that allows me to quickly
get back to my Quick Note

00:45:06.673 --> 00:45:09.009
containing any useful
information I found.

00:45:10.277 --> 00:45:13.080
You'll notice there's text
highlighted on the page.

00:45:13.113 --> 00:45:15.616
And I added this text
to my Quick Note.

00:45:15.649 --> 00:45:17.751
And tapping on a link
from a highlight

00:45:17.784 --> 00:45:20.420
takes me right to
the content on the page.

00:45:20.454 --> 00:45:23.690
I can add a link
from almost any app I'm using,

00:45:23.724 --> 00:45:25.792
including third-party apps.

00:45:25.826 --> 00:45:28.428
Here's a link from Yelp,
and if I tap,

00:45:28.462 --> 00:45:31.064
it takes me right
to the restaurant listing.

00:45:31.098 --> 00:45:33.300
I can swipe
across my Quick Note

00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:35.135
to see my most recent ones.

00:45:35.169 --> 00:45:37.905
And anytime I want to see
all my Quick Notes,

00:45:37.938 --> 00:45:42.176
I can find them right
where you'd expect, in Notes.

00:45:42.209 --> 00:45:43.744
Now back to Craig.

00:45:43.777 --> 00:45:45.445
[Craig] Thanks, Will.

00:45:45.479 --> 00:45:47.080
So that's Quick Note,

00:45:47.114 --> 00:45:49.816
a new way to capture
information anywhere.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:53.053
Quick Notes can be created
on iPadOS and macOS,

00:45:53.086 --> 00:45:56.323
and you can access
and edit them later on iOS.

00:45:56.356 --> 00:45:59.193
Now let's talk about Translate.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.629
In just one year, Translate
has already helped users

00:46:02.663 --> 00:46:05.098
make billions of translations
on iOS.

00:46:05.132 --> 00:46:08.569
So we're excited to bring
Translate to iPad,

00:46:08.602 --> 00:46:12.172
with experiences that leverage
iPad's unique capabilities,

00:46:12.206 --> 00:46:14.441
like practicing handwriting
in another language

00:46:14.474 --> 00:46:16.276
with Apple Pencil

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:18.178
or translating
right next to your document

00:46:18.212 --> 00:46:19.513
with Split View.

00:46:19.546 --> 00:46:22.249
And Translate was designed
for conversations.

00:46:22.282 --> 00:46:24.618
So we're making conversations
feel easier

00:46:24.651 --> 00:46:27.855
and even more natural
with Auto Translate.

00:46:28.388 --> 00:46:30.657
Auto Translate detects
when you're speaking,

00:46:30.691 --> 00:46:32.226
and in which language,

00:46:32.259 --> 00:46:34.962
so no one needs to tap a button
to respond.

00:46:34.995 --> 00:46:36.997
Just speak
and let Translate do the rest.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:40.868
We're also excited to announce
system-wide translation.

00:46:40.901 --> 00:46:42.836
So you can translate
text anywhere.

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:45.839
Just select the text
and tap Translate.

00:46:45.873 --> 00:46:49.776
With Live Text, you can even
translate text in a photo.

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:51.745
System-wide translation
is available

00:46:51.778 --> 00:46:54.481
on iPadOS, iOS, and macOS,

00:46:54.515 --> 00:46:56.984
and of course,
you can download languages

00:46:57.017 --> 00:46:59.553
to use all of these features
on-device.

00:46:59.586 --> 00:47:01.522
Whether you're working
on a document

00:47:01.555 --> 00:47:03.123
or meeting with someone,

00:47:03.156 --> 00:47:06.293
Translate makes iPad
even more powerful.

00:47:06.326 --> 00:47:10.030
Now let's talk
about Swift Playgrounds

00:47:10.063 --> 00:47:13.300
and how it's bringing a whole
new dimension of productivity

00:47:13.333 --> 00:47:14.535
to iPad.

00:47:14.568 --> 00:47:17.771
Swift Playgrounds is a great way
to learn to code

00:47:17.804 --> 00:47:20.140
through a series
of Apple-designed lesson plans

00:47:20.174 --> 00:47:22.442
that are interactive and fun.

00:47:22.476 --> 00:47:25.012
This year we're taking it
even further

00:47:25.045 --> 00:47:28.315
by adding the ability
to build apps on iPad.

00:47:28.348 --> 00:47:30.751
You build these apps
with Swift UI,

00:47:30.784 --> 00:47:32.386
which makes development easy.

00:47:32.419 --> 00:47:34.421
The code you write
is immediately reflected

00:47:34.454 --> 00:47:35.989
in a live preview of your app.

00:47:36.023 --> 00:47:39.092
This new project type
even works with Xcode on Mac.

00:47:39.126 --> 00:47:42.462
Swift Playgrounds now supports
improved code completion,

00:47:42.496 --> 00:47:43.764
so you can just start typing

00:47:43.797 --> 00:47:46.633
and quickly add the suggestion
to your code.

00:47:46.667 --> 00:47:48.569
You also have access
to the whole library

00:47:48.602 --> 00:47:50.170
of UI components

00:47:50.204 --> 00:47:52.372
and the documentation
to go with it.

00:47:52.406 --> 00:47:54.374
And if you're new
to app development,

00:47:54.408 --> 00:47:56.777
there's a guide
to creating your first app.

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:58.278
While you're developing
your app,

00:47:58.312 --> 00:48:00.647
you can run it full-screen
to try it out,

00:48:00.681 --> 00:48:01.782
and when you're ready,

00:48:01.815 --> 00:48:04.384
you can even submit it
to the App Store.

00:48:04.418 --> 00:48:05.953
This is amazing!

00:48:05.986 --> 00:48:10.490
You can now build apps
for iPhone and iPad on iPad.

00:48:11.425 --> 00:48:14.428
We think this will take iPad
to new places.

00:48:14.461 --> 00:48:16.930
That's iPadOS 15,

00:48:16.964 --> 00:48:20.334
taking the versatility of iPad
even further

00:48:20.367 --> 00:48:22.636
with new widget layouts
for your home screen,

00:48:22.669 --> 00:48:26.440
App library, and a redesigned
multitasking experience,

00:48:26.473 --> 00:48:29.042
new note-taking
and translation features,

00:48:29.076 --> 00:48:32.212
and the ability to build
apps with Swift Playgrounds.

00:48:32.246 --> 00:48:35.349
Combined with the great new
features we talked about in iOS,

00:48:35.382 --> 00:48:39.219
it's time to completely rethink
what you can do with your iPad.

00:48:39.253 --> 00:48:42.289
Next, let's get into Privacy.

00:48:42.322 --> 00:48:45.292
[energetic music]

00:48:45.325 --> 00:48:51.698
♪ ♪

00:48:51.732 --> 00:48:56.303
At Apple, we believe privacy
is a fundamental human right.

00:48:56.336 --> 00:48:58.005
We don't think you should
have to make a trade-off

00:48:58.038 --> 00:49:00.774
between great features
and privacy.

00:49:00.807 --> 00:49:02.576
We believe you deserve both.

00:49:02.609 --> 00:49:04.278
Since the beginning,

00:49:04.311 --> 00:49:06.113
we've worked to help you
keep your personal data

00:49:06.146 --> 00:49:07.748
under your control.

00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:09.516
And over the years,
we've integrated

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.084
powerful privacy controls

00:49:11.118 --> 00:49:13.687
into our operating systems,
most recently adding

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.624
Privacy Nutrition Labels
and App Tracking Transparency.

00:49:17.658 --> 00:49:21.361
Today, privacy
is more important than ever,

00:49:21.395 --> 00:49:22.996
because when you use
the internet

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:24.965
and third-party apps,
you can be tracked

00:49:24.998 --> 00:49:27.634
by a complex ecosystem
of data brokers

00:49:27.668 --> 00:49:31.371
and ad tech firms,
often without your permission.

00:49:31.405 --> 00:49:33.473
We don't think this is right.

00:49:33.507 --> 00:49:35.542
We believe
in protecting your privacy

00:49:35.576 --> 00:49:38.011
and giving you
transparency and control

00:49:38.045 --> 00:49:40.113
over your information.

00:49:40.147 --> 00:49:41.715
And to tell you
about the new ways

00:49:41.748 --> 00:49:43.650
we're giving you
even more control,

00:49:43.684 --> 00:49:45.686
here are Katie and Erik.

00:49:47.688 --> 00:49:48.722
[Katie] Thanks, Craig.

00:49:48.755 --> 00:49:50.924
Let's start with Mail.

00:49:50.958 --> 00:49:55.128
If you're like me, you get a lot
of marketing emails like this.

00:49:55.162 --> 00:49:58.165
What you may not realize
is that many of these emails

00:49:58.198 --> 00:50:00.234
use invisible pixels

00:49:58.198 --> 00:50:00.234
use invisible pixels

00:50:00.267 --> 00:50:03.003
to collect information
about your Mail activity,

00:50:03.036 --> 00:50:06.707
like when you open a message
and even your IP address.

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.109
We think you
should be able to choose

00:50:09.142 --> 00:50:10.644
whether to allow this or not.

00:50:10.677 --> 00:50:12.713
So now in the Mail app,

00:50:12.746 --> 00:50:16.316
we're introducing
Mail Privacy Protection.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.951
Here's what it does.

00:50:17.985 --> 00:50:20.954
It hides your IP address
so senders can't link it

00:50:20.988 --> 00:50:25.125
to your other online activity
or determine your location.

00:50:25.158 --> 00:50:26.793
And it prevents senders

00:50:26.827 --> 00:50:30.030
from seeing if and when
you've opened their email.

00:50:30.063 --> 00:50:33.567
So now you can catch up on email
with greater peace of mind.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.369
[Erik] Safari leads the industry

00:50:35.402 --> 00:50:37.671
in protecting you
against cross-site tracking

00:50:37.704 --> 00:50:39.473
with Intelligent Tracking
Prevention,

00:50:39.506 --> 00:50:41.675
and this year, we're making it
even stronger

00:50:41.708 --> 00:50:43.877
by also hiding your IP address
from trackers

00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:45.145
so they can't use it

00:50:45.179 --> 00:50:47.080
to link your activity
across different sites

00:50:47.114 --> 00:50:48.649
or learn your location.

00:50:48.682 --> 00:50:51.418
You can see which trackers
are prevented from profiling you

00:50:51.451 --> 00:50:53.420
in the Safari Privacy Report.

00:50:53.453 --> 00:50:55.255
We wanted to bring
this same transparency

00:50:55.289 --> 00:50:56.657
to apps you use too.

00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:00.060
[Katie] So we're introducing
the App Privacy Report.

00:51:00.093 --> 00:51:01.995
This new section in Settings

00:51:02.029 --> 00:51:05.432
gives you an overview
of how apps treat your privacy.

00:51:05.465 --> 00:51:08.735
You can see how often apps use
the permission you've granted

00:51:08.769 --> 00:51:13.707
to access your location, photos,
camera, microphone,

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:17.177
contacts, and more,
during the last 7 days.

00:51:17.211 --> 00:51:20.447
And to find out who your data
may be shared with,

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.518
you can see all the third party
domains the app is contacting.

00:51:24.551 --> 00:51:28.722
So these are our new privacy
system controls.

00:51:28.755 --> 00:51:31.024
Now let's talk about Siri.

00:51:31.058 --> 00:51:34.561
Siri's available across
all your Apple devices,

00:51:34.595 --> 00:51:36.697
allowing you
to quickly get things done

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:38.599
with just your voice.

00:51:38.632 --> 00:51:40.968
And Siri is being used
more than ever

00:51:41.001 --> 00:51:44.571
on over 600 million devices
each month.

00:51:44.605 --> 00:51:47.641
We recently added
more diverse Siri voice options,

00:51:47.674 --> 00:51:49.142
and they sound incredible.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:54.381
[Siri] Hi, I'm Siri.
If you need anything, just ask.

00:51:54.414 --> 00:51:57.784
[Katie] Now, Siri has a ton
of great new features this year,

00:51:57.818 --> 00:52:01.788
but today we want to focus
on a major update to privacy.

00:52:01.822 --> 00:52:03.690
[Erik] Siri's designed to
process

00:52:03.724 --> 00:52:05.559
as much data on device
as possible,

00:52:05.592 --> 00:52:07.327
keeping your information
private,

00:52:07.361 --> 00:52:09.196
and with the power
of the Neural Engine,

00:52:09.229 --> 00:52:10.631
we're able to do this
more than ever.

00:52:10.664 --> 00:52:14.434
Today we're introducing
on-device speech recognition.

00:52:14.468 --> 00:52:15.936
This means that, by default,

00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:18.872
your audio is all processed
right on your iPhone or iPad.

00:52:18.906 --> 00:52:21.475
This addresses the biggest
privacy concern we hear

00:52:21.508 --> 00:52:24.711
for voice assistants, which
is unwanted audio recording.

00:52:24.745 --> 00:52:27.548
And this has some great
benefits beyond privacy.

00:52:27.581 --> 00:52:30.017
First, you can now
make many requests

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:31.618
without an internet connection:

00:52:31.652 --> 00:52:34.821
launch apps, change settings,
control music, and more.

00:52:34.855 --> 00:52:37.491
Second, on-device processing
speeds things up.

00:52:37.524 --> 00:52:38.792
Check this out.

00:52:38.825 --> 00:52:40.994
I'll do a few requests
back to back.

00:52:41.028 --> 00:52:42.529
Open Photos.

00:52:44.298 --> 00:52:46.066
Open Calendar.

00:52:48.001 --> 00:52:49.469
Turn on Airplane Mode.

00:52:51.305 --> 00:52:53.540
Set a timer for 20 minutes.

00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:57.477
Switch to dark mode.

00:52:59.847 --> 00:53:02.683
Wake me up at 7:00 a.m.

00:53:02.716 --> 00:53:05.886
It's amazing how fast Siri is
with on-device processing.

00:53:05.919 --> 00:53:07.721
So those are some
of the powerful

00:53:07.754 --> 00:53:10.457
new privacy protections
in Mail, Safari, and your apps,

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:13.060
along with on-device
speech recognition for Siri.

00:53:13.093 --> 00:53:14.394
Back to you, Craig.

00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:18.932
[Craig] Next, another part
of our ecosystem

00:53:18.966 --> 00:53:22.102
that puts your privacy first
is iCloud.

00:53:22.135 --> 00:53:25.606
Here to tell you about some
great new updates is Mike.

00:53:26.306 --> 00:53:29.276
[upbeat music]

00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:36.216
♪ ♪

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.751
[Mike] Many of us rely on iCloud

00:53:37.784 --> 00:53:40.053
to safely store
a lot of personal information,

00:53:40.087 --> 00:53:42.456
and it's important
to always have access.

00:53:42.489 --> 00:53:45.092
So let's start off
with two improvements

00:53:45.125 --> 00:53:47.094
we're making to your Apple ID.

00:53:47.127 --> 00:53:49.696
First, we're adding a new way
to get back into your account

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:52.666
if you forget your password
or get locked out.

00:53:52.699 --> 00:53:54.835
You'll now have the option
to add people you trust,

00:53:54.868 --> 00:53:58.338
like your family and friends,
to a Recovery Contact list.

00:53:58.372 --> 00:54:00.574
They won't get any access
to your account,

00:54:00.607 --> 00:54:02.409
but if you ever forget
your password,

00:54:02.442 --> 00:54:04.945
you can call them
to get the code you need

00:54:04.978 --> 00:54:06.413
to get right back in.

00:54:06.446 --> 00:54:09.616
It's fast, easy, and secure.

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:13.120
Second, we're launching
a new Digital Legacy program.

00:54:13.153 --> 00:54:14.955
We don't often think about it,

00:54:14.988 --> 00:54:17.191
but it's important
that we can easily pass down

00:54:17.224 --> 00:54:21.295
information to family members
or friends when we pass away.

00:54:21.328 --> 00:54:23.197
You'll now be able to add people
to your account

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:25.032
as Legacy Contacts.

00:54:25.065 --> 00:54:28.836
So when you're gone,
they can simply request access,

00:54:28.869 --> 00:54:30.838
and your information
can be passed along

00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:33.340
quickly and easily.

00:54:33.373 --> 00:54:35.976
iCloud has always kept your
important information--

00:54:36.009 --> 00:54:38.679
like photos, documents,
and notes--

00:54:38.712 --> 00:54:42.749
safe, up to date, and accessible
across all of your devices,

00:54:42.783 --> 00:54:45.752
and today, we're making
some big updates.

00:54:45.786 --> 00:54:47.688
We're upgrading
our paid subscription

00:54:47.721 --> 00:54:50.891
to something
that we call iCloud+.

00:54:50.924 --> 00:54:54.161
iCloud+ combines
everything you love about iCloud

00:54:54.194 --> 00:54:56.096
with some great new features,

00:54:56.129 --> 00:55:00.100
starting with something to help
protect your privacy online.

00:55:00.133 --> 00:55:03.237
On any given day, we all use
a variety of networks

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:04.638
to browse the web:

00:55:04.671 --> 00:55:06.573
from the internet
in our own homes.

00:55:06.607 --> 00:55:08.509
to public Wi-Fi on the go.

00:55:08.542 --> 00:55:11.778
And behind the scenes,
network providers and websites

00:55:11.812 --> 00:55:14.448
can combine your identity
and browsing history

00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:17.384
into a detailed profile
about you.

00:55:17.417 --> 00:55:20.053
So now, in addition
to everything that Safari does

00:55:20.087 --> 00:55:23.690
to protect you online,
we are introducing a new service

00:55:23.724 --> 00:55:25.959
called Private Relay.

00:55:25.993 --> 00:55:28.095
It lets you browse with Safari

00:55:28.128 --> 00:55:30.464
in an even more secure
and private way.

00:55:30.497 --> 00:55:32.199
And the way it works
is really cool.

00:55:34.568 --> 00:55:37.838
It ensures that the traffic
leaving your device is encrypted

00:55:37.871 --> 00:55:40.674
so that no one
can intercept and read it.

00:55:40.707 --> 00:55:42.009
Then all of your requests

00:55:42.042 --> 00:55:44.678
are sent through two separate
internet relays.

00:55:44.711 --> 00:55:47.548
It's designed so that no one,
including Apple,

00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:48.849
can see both who you are

00:55:48.882 --> 00:55:50.551
and what sites you're visiting,

00:55:50.584 --> 00:55:53.720
and it does all this without
compromising performance.

00:55:53.754 --> 00:55:58.025
Next, let's talk about another
iCloud+ feature: Hide My Email.

00:55:58.058 --> 00:55:59.860
We've all had moments
when we've thought twice

00:55:59.893 --> 00:56:01.862
about sharing
our personal email address,

00:56:01.895 --> 00:56:03.997
like when we're filling out
a form on the web.

00:56:04.031 --> 00:56:07.201
With Hide My Email, you can
share a unique, random address

00:56:07.234 --> 00:56:09.937
that forwards messages
to your personal inbox.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:13.207
It's built right into Mail,
Safari, and iCloud Settings.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.410
So it's easy to set up
as many addresses as you need

00:56:16.443 --> 00:56:19.179
and delete them at any time,
keeping you in control.

00:56:20.047 --> 00:56:22.749
iCloud+ also includes
built-in support

00:56:22.783 --> 00:56:24.351
for HomeKit Secure Video.

00:56:24.384 --> 00:56:26.620
More and more of us
are using security cameras

00:56:26.653 --> 00:56:28.188
to keep an eye on our homes.

00:56:28.222 --> 00:56:32.159
With iCloud+, you can connect
more cameras than ever,

00:56:32.192 --> 00:56:34.895
and none of the video counts
against your iCloud storage.

00:56:34.928 --> 00:56:37.197
It's just a part
of your subscription.

00:56:37.231 --> 00:56:38.699
Of course, you'll still get

00:56:38.732 --> 00:56:40.567
everything else
you love about iCloud,

00:56:40.601 --> 00:56:43.804
including Photos,
Backup, and iCloud Drive.

00:56:43.837 --> 00:56:47.608
And the best part is we're not
changing our prices at all.

00:56:47.641 --> 00:56:51.044
You'll get all of iCloud plus
our new Private Relay service,

00:56:51.078 --> 00:56:54.915
Hide My Email and expanded
HomeKit secure video support

00:56:54.948 --> 00:56:56.950
for the same low price
as we offer today.

00:56:56.984 --> 00:56:58.719
We're really excited
to be giving users

00:56:58.752 --> 00:57:01.555
an even more private
and connected experience

00:57:01.588 --> 00:57:03.257
with iCloud+.

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:05.859
Now over to Sumbul for the
latest developments in Health.

00:57:05.893 --> 00:57:09.696
[upbeat music]

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:12.065
[Sumbul] Your health and
the well-being of your family

00:57:12.099 --> 00:57:13.734
is always important to you,

00:57:13.767 --> 00:57:15.636
and never more so
than this past year.

00:57:15.669 --> 00:57:18.605
Apple's commitment to health
is stronger than ever.

00:57:18.639 --> 00:57:20.507
We're collaborating
with medical experts

00:57:20.541 --> 00:57:22.476
to accelerate health innovation,

00:57:22.509 --> 00:57:25.345
and we're empowering individuals
to improve their health

00:57:25.379 --> 00:57:28.282
as well as make it easier
for them to participate

00:57:28.315 --> 00:57:30.117
in large-scale research studies.

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:31.585
With our APIs,

00:57:31.618 --> 00:57:33.720
developers are using our devices
and Health app

00:57:33.754 --> 00:57:36.557
to come up with ingenious ways
to push things forward.

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:37.858
Here's an example.

00:57:41.295 --> 00:57:43.063
[Francoise]
I’m Francoise Marvel.

00:57:43.096 --> 00:57:46.233
I’m a cardiology fellow
at Johns Hopkins.

00:57:46.266 --> 00:57:47.100
[Seth] Seth Martin.

00:57:47.134 --> 00:57:49.703
I’m also a cardiologist
at Johns Hopkins.

00:57:49.736 --> 00:57:52.372
[Francoise] Seth and I spend
our days

00:57:52.406 --> 00:57:54.741
alongside our patients
at the bedside.

00:57:54.775 --> 00:57:58.011
You know, six white coats,
hovering over a bed.

00:57:58.045 --> 00:58:00.414
And we’re trying
to actually share

00:58:00.447 --> 00:58:02.349
what the patient’s condition is.

00:58:02.382 --> 00:58:04.418
How they need to improve
their life.

00:58:04.451 --> 00:58:06.720
We use medical jargon.
We speak quickly.

00:58:06.753 --> 00:58:08.388
We confuse patients.

00:58:08.422 --> 00:58:10.357
And they’re left on their own.

00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:14.895
There has to be a better way
than just treating a patient,

00:58:14.928 --> 00:58:17.564
handing them a bunch of papers,
and expecting

00:58:17.598 --> 00:58:20.367
that they’re gonna understand
how to change their life.

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.537
We thought, well, what if we
completely reengineer

00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:26.773
the process for a heart attack
patient, by using ResearchKit,

00:58:26.807 --> 00:58:29.243
CareKit, HealthKit,
and then connecting it

00:58:29.276 --> 00:58:31.211
with an Apple Watch,
so we can bring in

00:58:31.245 --> 00:58:33.514
key cardiovascular metrics

00:58:33.547 --> 00:58:35.449
that help us to know
patients are doing well.

00:58:35.482 --> 00:58:38.986
[Seth] When Francoise was in the
technology accelerator program

00:58:39.019 --> 00:58:43.357
at Hopkins, the work there led
to this phone call with Apple

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:45.259
and towards the end
of the phone call,

00:58:45.292 --> 00:58:48.428
Francoise said to Divya
at Apple, “What can we do

00:58:49.096 --> 00:58:50.464
to accelerate this?”
And Divya said--

00:58:50.497 --> 00:58:52.699
[Divya] You guys gotta
come out to Cupertino.

00:58:54.968 --> 00:58:58.338
[Francoise] And we had
a Silicon Valley AirBnB.

00:58:58.372 --> 00:59:03.277
And we started side-by-side
coding with our iOS developers,

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:04.811
and then every couple hours--

00:59:04.845 --> 00:59:06.180
[Divya] We would talk
about their vision

00:59:06.213 --> 00:59:07.347
and tools they could leverage.

00:59:07.381 --> 00:59:09.349
[Francoise] We’d go to a
white board, and we’d lay out--

00:59:09.383 --> 00:59:10.851
[Divya] Here are the things
you guys should go tackle.

00:59:10.884 --> 00:59:14.588
[Francoise] And we’d go back
to our AirBnB, pour more coffee,

00:59:14.621 --> 00:59:17.491
you know, order some
bubble teas, eat some food.

00:59:17.524 --> 00:59:19.159
And then we would
go into Cupertino.

00:59:19.193 --> 00:59:22.563
[Divya] They’d come back into
Cupertino, piled in a minivan.

00:59:22.596 --> 00:59:24.364
[Francoise] And spend like
almost the full day there,

00:59:24.398 --> 00:59:26.567
getting more feedback,
working with their teams.

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.302
[Divya] They would leave
our offices,

00:59:28.335 --> 00:59:30.137
and work through the night

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:32.673
building and implementing
the things we had talked about.

00:59:32.706 --> 00:59:34.708
With our tools and their vision,

00:59:34.741 --> 00:59:38.345
we ultimately made magic
together.

00:59:38.378 --> 00:59:43.517
[Francoise] We left Cupertino
invigorated, and guess what?

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:46.386
Our clinical trial was able
to save

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:49.389
an incredible amount of people
from having complications

00:59:49.423 --> 00:59:50.657
and coming back to the hospital.

00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:54.561
And it reduced hospital
readmissions by 52%.

00:59:54.595 --> 00:59:56.263
And likely saved a lot of lives.

00:59:56.296 --> 00:59:58.065
[Divya] I remember we were just
sitting outside--

00:59:58.098 --> 00:59:59.766
beautiful Cupertino weather.

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.835
And it was just one of those
moments where it dawned on us

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.835
And it was just one of those
moments where it dawned on us

01:00:01.869 --> 01:00:03.737
that Corrie app was going
to have an impact

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:05.973
on so many people’s hearts
around the world.

01:00:06.006 --> 01:00:08.709
[Francoise] This is the start
of something incredible.

01:00:08.742 --> 01:00:11.478
It’s the spark,
and now it’s like fire

01:00:15.148 --> 01:00:17.985
[Sumbul] This is just one of the
many inspiring stories out there

01:00:18.018 --> 01:00:20.621
and is a testament
to the innovative work happening

01:00:20.654 --> 01:00:22.422
in the medical community.

01:00:22.456 --> 01:00:24.658
A critical part
of taking care of yourself

01:00:24.691 --> 01:00:26.793
is monitoring changes
in your health,

01:00:26.827 --> 01:00:29.429
which can be subtle
and easy to miss over time.

01:00:29.463 --> 01:00:32.199
So this year, we're offering
three new features

01:00:32.232 --> 01:00:34.868
to help you to identify,
measure,

01:00:34.902 --> 01:00:37.704
and understand those changes,
and here's Adeeti

01:00:37.738 --> 01:00:39.840
to tell you about the first
of these features.

01:00:41.275 --> 01:00:43.710
[Adeeti] Let's start
with mobility.

01:00:43.744 --> 01:00:45.045
The way that you move and walk

01:00:45.078 --> 01:00:48.048
can indicate balance issues
and gait impairment.

01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:51.151
This is the leading cause
of falls in adults.

01:00:51.185 --> 01:00:54.421
Currently, fall risk
is assessed by a care provider

01:00:54.454 --> 01:00:57.624
through a questionnaire
and an in-person evaluation.

01:00:57.658 --> 01:00:59.960
But this can miss out
on your everyday movement,

01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:02.663
so important changes
can go unnoticed.

01:01:02.696 --> 01:01:05.866
Your iPhone already captures
mobility data as you walk

01:01:05.899 --> 01:01:08.302
with scientifically validated
metrics.

01:01:08.335 --> 01:01:09.970
We're building on this
to introduce

01:01:10.003 --> 01:01:13.774
a completely new way
to assess your risk of falling

01:01:13.807 --> 01:01:16.844
called Walking Steadiness.

01:01:16.877 --> 01:01:18.278
For the first time ever,

01:01:18.312 --> 01:01:21.515
you can get insight
if your fall risk increases

01:01:21.548 --> 01:01:24.351
and take action early
to improve your steadiness.

01:01:24.384 --> 01:01:27.554
Let's take a quick look at some
of the science behind this.

01:01:27.588 --> 01:01:31.191
As you walk with your iPhone,
the built-in motion sensors

01:01:31.225 --> 01:01:35.996
automatically measure how fast
and how evenly you walk,

01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:39.766
the length of your steps,
and the timing of each step,

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.437
right down to how often you have
both feet on the ground.

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:46.206
Combined, these metrics
provide powerful insight

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.810
on changes in your balance,
stability, and coordination.

01:01:50.577 --> 01:01:51.979
We used real-world data

01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:53.580
from the Apple
Heart & Movement Study,

01:01:53.614 --> 01:01:56.817
with over 100,000 participants
across all ages.

01:01:56.850 --> 01:02:00.287
This is the largest data set
ever used to study fall risk,

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.824
and it's helped create this
first of its kind health metric.

01:02:03.857 --> 01:02:06.827
You can view your Walking
Steadiness in the Health app.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.996
You'll see a classification
of "OK"

01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:11.732
if the metrics show that
you're stable while walking.

01:02:11.765 --> 01:02:14.034
You can see how
your Walking Steadiness

01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:16.036
may change as the months go by

01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:18.505
and receive a notification
if your steadiness is low

01:02:18.539 --> 01:02:21.675
or very low and you're
at increased risk of falling.

01:02:21.708 --> 01:02:24.244
You can also learn how
to improve your steadiness.

01:02:24.278 --> 01:02:27.414
There are movement exercises
right in the Health app,

01:02:27.447 --> 01:02:30.317
and these can help you increase
your strength and balance

01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:32.853
and reduce your risk of falling.

01:02:32.886 --> 01:02:34.388
Now back to Sumbul

01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:37.591
to tell you about another way
to monitor health changes.

01:02:38.492 --> 01:02:40.727
[Sumbul] You can already
review lab results

01:02:40.761 --> 01:02:42.763
like your cholesterol
right in the Health app.

01:02:42.796 --> 01:02:46.800
In the U.S. alone, 14 billion
clinical laboratory tests

01:02:46.834 --> 01:02:48.101
are performed each year.

01:02:48.135 --> 01:02:51.071
That is a lot of information
to keep track of.

01:02:51.104 --> 01:02:53.006
When you see your own results
come in,

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.342
it can be hard to understand
what these tests mean

01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:56.510
or what has changed.

01:02:57.177 --> 01:03:00.347
The Health app will now include
detailed descriptions

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:03.183
to help you better understand
your lab data.

01:03:03.217 --> 01:03:06.119
For example, when you
receive a cholesterol result,

01:03:06.153 --> 01:03:09.256
you can now see that the LDL
is a bad cholesterol

01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:12.226
and having too much may put you
at risk for heart disease.

01:03:12.259 --> 01:03:14.161
You can also now see
whether your labs

01:03:14.194 --> 01:03:15.829
are within expected ranges.

01:03:15.863 --> 01:03:17.631
Together, these views
will help you

01:03:17.664 --> 01:03:20.534
get even more meaning
from your lab results.

01:03:20.567 --> 01:03:22.736
Many health changes
happen over time,

01:03:22.769 --> 01:03:24.171
so to better understand
your health

01:03:24.204 --> 01:03:28.408
even more holistically,
we're introducing Trends.

01:03:28.442 --> 01:03:30.811
You'll get insight
on long-term changes

01:03:30.844 --> 01:03:33.614
across areas such as steps,
resting heart rate,

01:03:33.647 --> 01:03:36.216
blood glucose, sleep,
and much more.

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:38.018
You'll also be alerted
when there's a new trend

01:03:38.051 --> 01:03:39.720
in your data,
which may be something

01:03:39.753 --> 01:03:41.255
you want to monitor more closely

01:03:41.288 --> 01:03:42.856
or even discuss
with your physician.

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:44.625
So if you're getting
more daily walks in,

01:03:44.658 --> 01:03:46.260
your health summary will show

01:03:46.293 --> 01:03:47.794
that your steps taken
have increased

01:03:47.828 --> 01:03:49.096
over the last few months.

01:03:49.129 --> 01:03:51.265
This is a great way
to celebrate progress

01:03:51.298 --> 01:03:52.900
towards meeting
your health goals

01:03:52.933 --> 01:03:55.402
and a powerful new way
to get early insight

01:03:55.435 --> 01:03:56.937
into potential health issues.

01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:59.139
With Trends,
Walking Steadiness,

01:03:59.173 --> 01:04:00.908
and a better Labs experience,

01:04:00.941 --> 01:04:03.243
you have three new ways
to see changes

01:04:03.277 --> 01:04:04.978
in your overall health.

01:04:05.012 --> 01:04:07.915
Another really important
part of managing your health

01:04:07.948 --> 01:04:10.150
is having meaningful
conversations with your doctor.

01:04:10.184 --> 01:04:13.420
During your visit, physicians
look at your vitals and labs

01:04:13.453 --> 01:04:15.756
but will also ask you about
everyday health activities

01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:17.925
like exercise and sleep.

01:04:17.958 --> 01:04:19.726
And patients can often
have difficulty

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.562
remembering all these details.

01:04:21.595 --> 01:04:24.798
But the Health app has all of
this valuable information,

01:04:24.831 --> 01:04:27.034
so, to support this
conversation,

01:04:27.067 --> 01:04:29.937
you can now share
health data that you choose

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:33.106
with your healthcare provider
in a private way.

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:35.776
For example, if you have a
concern about your heart health,

01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:37.778
you can now share
your heart data.

01:04:37.811 --> 01:04:39.446
This is shared securely.

01:04:39.479 --> 01:04:43.083
No one else, including Apple,
will see this information.

01:04:43.116 --> 01:04:45.352
Your doctor can then view
this data directly

01:04:45.385 --> 01:04:47.387
from their electronic
health record system

01:04:47.421 --> 01:04:50.791
and look for important trends
such as changes in activity

01:04:50.824 --> 01:04:53.460
and a history of alerts
like high heart rate.

01:04:53.493 --> 01:04:55.696
Access to this information
helps give your doctor

01:04:55.729 --> 01:04:57.831
a more complete view
of your everyday health

01:04:57.865 --> 01:04:59.433
outside of the clinic.

01:04:59.466 --> 01:05:01.768
We're so excited about
this new capability

01:05:01.802 --> 01:05:03.770
to share your data
from the Health app

01:05:03.804 --> 01:05:04.972
directly with your doctor.

01:05:05.005 --> 01:05:07.441
These electronic health
record companies in the U.S.

01:05:07.474 --> 01:05:09.309
will be the first
to support this feature,

01:05:09.343 --> 01:05:11.778
and we look forward
to expanding availability

01:05:11.812 --> 01:05:14.548
even more in the coming months.

01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:16.850
Now, for many of us,
it's not just the changes

01:05:16.884 --> 01:05:18.819
in our own health we care about.

01:05:18.852 --> 01:05:21.088
It's the health of our family
and loved ones too,

01:05:21.121 --> 01:05:23.657
whether they live with us
or far away.

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:26.193
For some of us, that means
taking care of our kids

01:05:26.226 --> 01:05:28.428
and for others,
it's our aging parents.

01:05:28.462 --> 01:05:29.630
And for many of us,

01:05:29.663 --> 01:05:31.298
it's actually taking care of
both--

01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:33.433
generations above and below.

01:05:33.467 --> 01:05:35.636
To empower you
to care for others,

01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:37.971
we're introducing
Health Sharing,

01:05:38.005 --> 01:05:40.941
a private and secure way
to view health data,

01:05:40.974 --> 01:05:44.978
trends, and alerts for the
people most important to you.

01:05:45.012 --> 01:05:47.481
For example, I could set up
a sharing relationship

01:05:47.514 --> 01:05:49.183
with my mom,
and with her permission,

01:05:49.216 --> 01:05:51.151
I could view data
like her heart rate,

01:05:51.185 --> 01:05:52.753
activity, and labs.

01:05:52.786 --> 01:05:54.755
And just like with my own
health data,

01:05:54.788 --> 01:05:57.591
Trends proactively highlights
changes in my Mom's health data

01:05:57.624 --> 01:05:58.692
for me.

01:05:58.725 --> 01:06:00.994
I can also receive
notifications,

01:06:01.028 --> 01:06:02.863
including
high heart rate alerts,

01:06:02.896 --> 01:06:05.199
changes in mobility,
and more.

01:06:05.232 --> 01:06:08.168
And it's easy for me to connect
with her about her health.

01:06:08.202 --> 01:06:09.937
So if I see a noteworthy change

01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:11.905
like her resting heart rate
increasing,

01:06:11.939 --> 01:06:13.307
I can simply tap Messages

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.776
and start a conversation
with my mom.

01:06:15.809 --> 01:06:18.412
This is a powerful new way
to stay connected

01:06:18.445 --> 01:06:20.614
to the wellbeing
of those you love.

01:06:20.647 --> 01:06:22.149
You'll have peace of mind,

01:06:22.182 --> 01:06:24.084
and they'll know they have
a trusted partner

01:06:24.117 --> 01:06:25.619
on their health journey.

01:06:25.652 --> 01:06:27.855
Since the beginning
of our work in Health,

01:06:27.888 --> 01:06:30.023
all of our health features
have been architected

01:06:30.057 --> 01:06:32.492
to keep your data secure
and protect your privacy.

01:06:32.526 --> 01:06:35.062
Your health data
is under your control

01:06:35.095 --> 01:06:37.397
and is encrypted in transit
and at rest.

01:06:37.431 --> 01:06:39.900
The permissions built into
the sharing experience

01:06:39.933 --> 01:06:41.902
give you granular control

01:06:41.935 --> 01:06:44.571
over which types of data
you share and with whom.

01:06:44.605 --> 01:06:46.607
And you can make changes
at any time

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.675
right from the Sharing tab.

01:06:48.709 --> 01:06:51.512
Data you share is sent
in an encrypted form,

01:06:51.545 --> 01:06:55.616
and Apple does not have access
to any of this information.

01:06:55.649 --> 01:06:58.452
Privacy is fundamental in
the design and development

01:06:58.485 --> 01:07:00.020
across all of our
Health features.

01:07:00.053 --> 01:07:03.023
We're so excited
for what's coming in Health--

01:07:03.056 --> 01:07:05.959
a first-of-its-kind metric
to access fall risk,

01:07:05.993 --> 01:07:08.962
richer insights to understand
changes in your health,

01:07:08.996 --> 01:07:12.666
and completely new abilities
for you to privately share

01:07:12.699 --> 01:07:15.836
selected data with your doctors
and loved ones.

01:07:15.869 --> 01:07:19.139
Now I'll hand it over to Kevin
to talk about watchOS.

01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:28.749
[Kevin] Apple Watch is already

01:07:28.782 --> 01:07:30.784
the most loved watch
in the world.

01:07:30.817 --> 01:07:33.720
It keeps you healthy,
active, and connected.

01:07:34.521 --> 01:07:36.223
With features like
Fall Detection,

01:07:36.256 --> 01:07:38.058
ECG, and Cycle Tracking,

01:07:38.091 --> 01:07:41.094
Apple Watch is an essential
health companion.

01:07:41.128 --> 01:07:42.996
It motivates you to close
your Activity rings

01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:45.499
and transforms the way
you stay fit.

01:07:45.532 --> 01:07:47.267
And staying connected
to the people and things

01:07:47.301 --> 01:07:49.536
you care about most
is easy with Apple Watch--

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:50.971
all from your wrist.

01:07:51.004 --> 01:07:53.807
In watchOS 8, we're introducing
more capabilities

01:07:53.841 --> 01:07:55.409
in each of these areas.

01:07:55.442 --> 01:07:56.810
Let's start with health.

01:07:56.844 --> 01:07:58.912
More than ever,
people are realizing

01:07:58.946 --> 01:08:02.149
the importance of dedicating
time to practice mindfulness.

01:08:02.182 --> 01:08:04.718
In fact, the Breathe app
has grown in popularity,

01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:06.486
particularly over
this last year.

01:08:07.521 --> 01:08:10.290
In watchOS 8, the Breathe app
has been enhanced

01:08:10.324 --> 01:08:11.525
to give you more opportunities

01:08:11.558 --> 01:08:14.795
to slow down and be mindful,
including a new animation

01:08:14.828 --> 01:08:16.530
that has a beautiful
look and feel

01:08:16.563 --> 01:08:19.099
to help you center and calm
as you breathe.

01:08:20.701 --> 01:08:22.536
We're also introducing Reflect--

01:08:22.569 --> 01:08:24.505
a new way for you to be
more mindful.

01:08:24.538 --> 01:08:26.340
For example,
a reflection could be

01:08:26.373 --> 01:08:28.175
"Think about something
you love to do

01:08:28.208 --> 01:08:29.943
and why it brings you joy."

01:08:29.977 --> 01:08:32.779
A gentle animation
helps you focus.

01:08:33.947 --> 01:08:36.416
And studies show that regular
mindful moments like this

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:38.552
can lead to increased
positive emotions

01:08:38.585 --> 01:08:41.221
and overall psychological
well-being.

01:08:41.255 --> 01:08:44.658
The Reflect and Breathe sessions
live in the new Mindfulness app.

01:08:44.691 --> 01:08:47.761
This will help you reduce stress
and relax your body and mind.

01:08:48.362 --> 01:08:49.296
With the Sleep app,

01:08:49.329 --> 01:08:50.864
we introduced
an entirely new way

01:08:50.898 --> 01:08:52.132
for you to meet
your sleep goals

01:08:52.165 --> 01:08:54.067
and track metrics
like time asleep,

01:08:54.101 --> 01:08:56.203
heart rate,
and even blood oxygen.

01:08:56.236 --> 01:08:57.437
In watchOS 8,

01:08:57.471 --> 01:08:58.939
Apple Watch can track
another key metric

01:08:58.972 --> 01:09:00.107
while sleeping--

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.909
Respiratory Rate.

01:09:01.942 --> 01:09:03.510
This is a vital sign
that measures

01:09:03.544 --> 01:09:04.912
how many breaths
you take per minute.

01:09:04.945 --> 01:09:06.880
And since your sleeping
respiratory rate

01:09:06.914 --> 01:09:08.782
tends to be consistent
over time,

01:09:08.815 --> 01:09:11.485
a change may indicate a shift
in your overall wellness.

01:09:11.518 --> 01:09:13.854
You'll be notified
if a meaningful trend

01:09:13.887 --> 01:09:16.290
in your respiratory rate
has been identified.

01:09:16.323 --> 01:09:18.025
And you can see
even more details

01:09:18.058 --> 01:09:20.160
in Respiratory Rate
in the Health app.

01:09:20.194 --> 01:09:22.129
Now I'd like to turn it over
to Julz

01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:24.398
to tell you what's coming
to help you stay active.

01:09:26.366 --> 01:09:28.235
[Julz] Apple Watch
is the perfect companion

01:09:28.268 --> 01:09:30.337
to motivate you to be more fit.

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:33.640
And watchOS 8 adds two of
the most popular workout types

01:09:33.674 --> 01:09:36.076
that are great for bringing
more mindful movement

01:09:36.109 --> 01:09:37.711
to your routine.

01:09:37.744 --> 01:09:39.880
First, a new Tai Chi workout.

01:09:39.913 --> 01:09:42.716
This Chinese martial art
is thousands of years old

01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:45.485
and is often described
as meditation in motion.

01:09:45.519 --> 01:09:48.055
Its gentle approach
can help reduce stress

01:09:48.088 --> 01:09:50.357
and find a more peaceful
state of mind.

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:52.526
And a brand-new Pilates
workout type,

01:09:52.559 --> 01:09:54.962
which is one of the best ways
to develop core strength,

01:09:54.995 --> 01:09:57.698
posture, balance,
and flexibility.

01:09:57.731 --> 01:09:59.833
Of course, another way
people are staying fit

01:09:59.867 --> 01:10:01.568
is with Apple Fitness+,

01:09:59.867 --> 01:10:01.568
is with Apple Fitness+,

01:10:01.602 --> 01:10:05.272
the first service built
entirely around Apple Watch.

01:10:05.305 --> 01:10:07.174
We've heard from so many
of our users

01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:10.244
how it's making a positive
difference in their lives.

01:10:10.277 --> 01:10:13.847
And now, Fitness+ is introducing
a new series of workouts

01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:15.315
featuring Jeanette Jenkins,

01:10:15.349 --> 01:10:17.684
one of the most sought after
fitness experts.

01:10:17.718 --> 01:10:19.987
With seven workouts
focused on Strength

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:22.055
and High Intensity
Interval Training,

01:10:22.089 --> 01:10:23.223
she's bringing the fire

01:10:23.257 --> 01:10:26.493
and her belief that all bodies
are made to be strong.

01:10:26.527 --> 01:10:29.830
Because music is so key
to the Fitness+ experience,

01:10:29.863 --> 01:10:32.866
we're introducing
a new Artist Spotlight Series.

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.269
Each workout features
an entire playlist

01:10:35.302 --> 01:10:38.138
from Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez,

01:10:38.172 --> 01:10:40.307
Keith Urban, and Alicia Keys.

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:43.377
The Artist Spotlight Series and
the new workouts with Jeanette

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:45.679
will be available
later this month.

01:10:45.712 --> 01:10:49.016
With new workout types
and great new Fitness+ content,

01:10:49.049 --> 01:10:51.618
Apple Watch continues to be
an incredible motivator

01:10:51.652 --> 01:10:53.921
to help you stay active
and fit.

01:10:53.954 --> 01:10:57.457
Back to you, Kevin.

01:10:57.491 --> 01:10:59.092
[Kevin] Let's talk about
some new features

01:10:59.126 --> 01:11:01.195
to keep you connected
to the people you love.

01:11:01.228 --> 01:11:04.398
Photos are a great way
to relive your favorite moments

01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:06.200
and most precious memories.

01:11:06.233 --> 01:11:07.835
On Apples Watch,
the Photos face

01:11:07.868 --> 01:11:09.870
is the most popular Watch face.

01:11:09.903 --> 01:11:12.105
That's why watchOS 8 is bringing
another great way

01:11:12.139 --> 01:11:14.007
to enjoy your favorite photos

01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:16.476
with the new
Portraits Watch face.

01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:18.912
It takes the great portrait
photos from your iPhone

01:11:18.946 --> 01:11:20.647
and uses the segmentation data

01:11:20.681 --> 01:11:22.983
to create a multi-layered face
with depth.

01:11:23.016 --> 01:11:24.651
And you can make this watch face
your own

01:11:24.685 --> 01:11:27.487
by adjusting the photo's
composition and time placement

01:11:27.521 --> 01:11:29.823
to really make
the subject stand out.

01:11:29.857 --> 01:11:31.592
This is really great
to see live,

01:11:31.625 --> 01:11:34.027
so let me invite Shandra
to show you a demo.

01:11:35.929 --> 01:11:38.198
[Shandra] Thanks, Kevin.

01:11:38.232 --> 01:11:40.601
Your photo comes to life
when you raise your wrist.

01:11:40.634 --> 01:11:42.769
And as you scroll
the digital crown,

01:11:42.803 --> 01:11:44.938
you get a view
of the dynamic composition

01:11:44.972 --> 01:11:47.441
that makes this watch face
extraordinary.

01:11:47.474 --> 01:11:49.843
You're gonna love how this face
keeps you connected

01:11:49.877 --> 01:11:52.212
when you can't be face-to-face.

01:11:52.246 --> 01:11:53.547
Speaking of photos,

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.084
the Photos app itself
has been completely redesigned.

01:11:57.117 --> 01:11:59.419
It now includes
memory highlights,

01:11:59.453 --> 01:12:02.556
featured photos,
in addition to your favorites.

01:12:02.589 --> 01:12:03.991
If I tap into this memory,

01:12:04.024 --> 01:12:06.860
I can scroll through
the all-new mosaic layout.

01:12:08.228 --> 01:12:09.396
My daughter Wesleigh and I

01:12:09.429 --> 01:12:11.331
adopted our puppy Fondue
last year

01:12:11.365 --> 01:12:13.967
and are missing her
during the day.

01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:16.136
The new Photos app
makes it simple for us

01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:18.705
to quickly reminisce.

01:12:18.739 --> 01:12:21.008
This picture from my Memories
is a good one.

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:23.277
I'm gonna share it with Wesleigh
to remind her

01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:25.779
we're not always missing
Fondue's best moments.

01:12:25.812 --> 01:12:27.781
If I tap the share icon,

01:12:27.814 --> 01:12:30.751
you'll see that we now have
support for sharing photos

01:12:30.784 --> 01:12:34.221
via messages and mail,
directly from my Watch.

01:12:34.254 --> 01:12:36.089
Let's get this over to Wesleigh.

01:12:36.123 --> 01:12:38.225
I'm gonna tap add message
to show you

01:12:38.258 --> 01:12:40.961
that we've made it even easier
to compose a message.

01:12:41.862 --> 01:12:43.697
We can now dictate, Scribble,

01:12:43.730 --> 01:12:46.466
and add emojis in the same view.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.535
I always find it easy
to dictate my messages.

01:12:50.204 --> 01:12:52.539
Remember this?

01:12:53.774 --> 01:12:56.376
If I tap Scribble,
I can edit my text inline

01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:59.880
by selecting and deleting
what I'd like to change.

01:13:00.948 --> 01:13:02.950
And I can use the crown
to move the cursor

01:13:02.983 --> 01:13:06.019
and add additional text.

01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:07.921
And what message is complete
without emojis

01:13:07.955 --> 01:13:09.456
to get a point across?

01:13:09.489 --> 01:13:13.026
By tapping the emoji icon,
I can add multiple emojis

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.128
while in the Scribble view.

01:13:17.965 --> 01:13:20.434
watchOS 8 makes it easy
to send the perfect message

01:13:20.467 --> 01:13:22.236
right from your wrist.

01:13:22.269 --> 01:13:24.471
[chime]
That was quick.

01:13:24.505 --> 01:13:27.474
Wesleigh must have the puppy
on the brain too.

01:13:27.508 --> 01:13:29.042
And with GIFs now
on Apple Watch,

01:13:29.076 --> 01:13:32.446
I can reply as comedically
as I would from my iPhone.

01:13:32.479 --> 01:13:35.716
In the new app shelf,
you'll find #images.

01:13:35.749 --> 01:13:37.518
You can search
for the perfect GIF

01:13:37.551 --> 01:13:39.453
or choose from your recents.

01:13:39.486 --> 01:13:41.221
I think a face palm
best captures

01:13:41.255 --> 01:13:43.824
how this photo
makes me feel.

01:13:43.857 --> 01:13:45.959
And that's a look at
what's coming in watchOS 8

01:13:45.993 --> 01:13:47.494
to keep you connected
to the people

01:13:47.528 --> 01:13:49.963
and puppies you care about most.

01:13:49.997 --> 01:13:51.999
And now, back to Kevin.

01:13:54.001 --> 01:13:55.836
[Kevin] We think you're gonna
love these new features

01:13:55.869 --> 01:13:57.471
in Photos and Messages.

01:13:57.504 --> 01:13:59.239
And of course,
there's so much more,

01:13:59.273 --> 01:14:01.375
including Next Hour
Precipitation,

01:14:01.408 --> 01:14:04.978
support for Find Items,
and Multiple Timers.

01:14:05.012 --> 01:14:06.713
watchOS is the world's
most advanced

01:14:06.747 --> 01:14:08.515
wearable operating system.

01:14:08.549 --> 01:14:10.517
And watchOS 8
takes it even further

01:14:10.551 --> 01:14:12.786
with new features
to help you stay healthy,

01:14:12.819 --> 01:14:14.655
active, and connected.

01:14:14.688 --> 01:14:16.356
And now, over to Craig.

01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:19.359
[electronic music]

01:14:19.393 --> 01:14:24.631
♪ ♪

01:14:24.665 --> 01:14:27.034
[Craig] Let's talk
about the home.

01:14:27.067 --> 01:14:29.369
At Apple, we design
our products for the home

01:14:29.403 --> 01:14:31.839
to embody three key attributes

01:14:31.872 --> 01:14:34.641
starting with being easy to use.

01:14:34.675 --> 01:14:36.510
We believe the technology
in your home

01:14:36.543 --> 01:14:39.313
should work for you,
not the other way around.

01:14:39.346 --> 01:14:42.883
And we design our products
to work better together

01:14:42.916 --> 01:14:44.952
so that your iPhone,
HomePod mini,

01:14:44.985 --> 01:14:46.954
Apple TV, and other devices

01:14:46.987 --> 01:14:50.824
can leverage each other
to deliver seamless experiences.

01:14:50.858 --> 01:14:54.795
And everything we do is built
to be private and secure,

01:14:54.828 --> 01:14:56.830
which is so important
to all of us.

01:14:56.864 --> 01:14:59.633
With this foundation,
we have a great set of features

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:03.203
coming this year to make life
at home more enjoyable.

01:15:03.237 --> 01:15:06.006
To tell you more, here's Yah.

01:15:07.641 --> 01:15:10.410
At the heart of your smart home
is HomeKit,

01:15:10.444 --> 01:15:12.379
seamlessly orchestrating
and controlling

01:15:12.412 --> 01:15:13.881
your smart home accessories.

01:15:13.914 --> 01:15:16.717
And it all starts
at your front door.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.519
With our new Home Keys feature,

01:15:18.552 --> 01:15:20.521
simply tap your iPhone
or Apple Watch

01:15:20.554 --> 01:15:24.391
to securely unlock the door,
just like that.

01:15:24.424 --> 01:15:25.993
Now, sometimes
when you get home,

01:15:26.026 --> 01:15:28.495
you just can't wait
to watch your favorite show,

01:15:28.529 --> 01:15:30.764
so we've made that
easier than ever.

01:15:30.797 --> 01:15:33.901
Starting this fall, you can ask
Siri on HomePod mini

01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:35.869
to play something
on your Apple TV--

01:15:35.903 --> 01:15:37.204
completely hands-free.

01:15:37.237 --> 01:15:39.239
[mom] Hey, Siri, watch
the latest episode

01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:40.574
of Mosquito Coast.

01:15:40.607 --> 01:15:43.443
[Siri] Here's season one,
episode seven of Mosquito Coast.

01:15:46.246 --> 01:15:49.950
[Yah] For many of us, the only
thing better than watching TV

01:15:49.983 --> 01:15:53.854
is watching TV with friends.

01:15:53.887 --> 01:15:55.522
As you heard from Craig earlier,

01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:58.959
SharePlay is going to change
the way you enjoy TV together.

01:15:58.992 --> 01:16:01.161
You can watch it all
on Apple TV,

01:16:01.195 --> 01:16:03.030
in sync with your friends
on FaceTime,

01:16:03.063 --> 01:16:05.766
ensuring everyone catches
the movie's dramatic reveal

01:16:05.799 --> 01:16:08.202
or a show's punchline
at the same moment.

01:16:08.235 --> 01:16:09.770
And to make it easier
to see everything

01:16:09.803 --> 01:16:11.305

01:16:11.338 --> 01:16:13.373
the Apple TV app

"Shared with You" row,

01:16:14.575 --> 01:16:16.710
highlighting all the great
shows and movies

01:16:16.743 --> 01:16:18.946
your friends are sharing

01:16:18.979 --> 01:16:21.014
We also want to make it
easier to decide

01:16:21.048 --> 01:16:22.416
what to watch as a group,

01:16:22.449 --> 01:16:24.852
especially if Mom's
into action movies,

01:16:24.885 --> 01:16:26.420
Grandma loves sci-fi,

01:16:26.453 --> 01:16:28.589
and the teens
can't get enough of comedy.

01:16:28.622 --> 01:16:30.657
That's why we're introducing
a new row called

01:16:30.691 --> 01:16:32.993
"For All of You,"
with a collection of shows

01:16:33.026 --> 01:16:34.928
and movies based on
everyone's interests--

01:16:34.962 --> 01:16:37.164
perfect for family movie nights.

01:16:37.197 --> 01:16:38.899
And you can easily
fine tune the suggestions

01:16:38.932 --> 01:16:40.634
based on who's watching.

01:16:40.667 --> 01:16:42.536
Now, when you're ready
to watch something,

01:16:42.569 --> 01:16:44.037
you want it to sound amazing.

01:16:45.606 --> 01:16:48.041
So this fall, you can select
HomePod mini

01:16:48.075 --> 01:16:50.477
as the speakers for your
Apple TV 4K.

01:16:50.511 --> 01:16:52.646
With the power
of Computational Audio,

01:16:52.679 --> 01:16:55.616
HomePod mini delivers rich,
balanced sound

01:16:55.649 --> 01:16:58.218
and crystal-clear dialogue
for everything you watch.

01:17:04.057 --> 01:17:06.627
[Yah] HomePod mini is perfect
for any room,

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:09.162
like the Kitchen, where you can
convert measurements,

01:17:09.196 --> 01:17:11.732
set a timer,
or add to your grocery list.

01:17:11.765 --> 01:17:14.001
Of course, you can always
listen to Apple music

01:17:14.034 --> 01:17:16.036
and other popular
music services.

01:17:16.069 --> 01:17:17.271
And we're excited to add support

01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:20.607
for lossless audio, Apple Music,
later this year.

01:17:20.641 --> 01:17:21.608
Because we want more people

01:17:21.642 --> 01:17:23.944
to experience the magic
of HomePod mini,

01:17:23.977 --> 01:17:27.047
we're now making it available in
even more countries and regions.

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.716
In addition to everywhere
we ship HomePod mini today,

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:31.018
we're bringing it to Austria,

01:17:31.051 --> 01:17:33.287
Ireland, and New Zealand
this month.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.523
And it'll be available in Italy
by the end of the year.

01:17:36.557 --> 01:17:38.125
Also later this year,

01:17:38.158 --> 01:17:39.893
we'll begin bringing
voice recognition

01:17:39.927 --> 01:17:41.795
everywhere HomePod mini ships,

01:17:41.828 --> 01:17:45.098
giving each member of the home
a personalized experience.

01:17:45.132 --> 01:17:47.901
So each person can ask Siri
to send a message,

01:17:47.935 --> 01:17:49.303
set their own reminders,

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:51.738
or hear a playlist
curated just for them.

01:17:52.372 --> 01:17:53.907
We believe Siri is most powerful

01:17:53.941 --> 01:17:55.776
when it's available
throughout your house,

01:17:55.809 --> 01:17:57.277
which is why we're so excited

01:17:57.311 --> 01:17:59.913
to bring Siri
to third-party devices.

01:17:59.947 --> 01:18:02.616
For the first time,
HomeKit accessory makers

01:18:02.649 --> 01:18:04.585
can enable Siri
in their products,

01:18:04.618 --> 01:18:05.953
so you'll be able
to talk with Siri

01:18:05.986 --> 01:18:07.855
on even more devices.

01:18:07.888 --> 01:18:09.890
[grandma] Hey, Siri,
set the Dinner scene.

01:18:10.691 --> 01:18:12.826
[Yah] We've designed it
so that your Siri requests

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:13.961
flow to your HomePod

01:18:13.994 --> 01:18:16.230
without going
to any third-party servers,

01:18:16.263 --> 01:18:19.433
providing the privacy
you expect from Apple.

01:18:19.466 --> 01:18:20.767
Accessories enabled with Siri

01:18:20.801 --> 01:18:23.203
will be available
starting later this year.

01:18:23.237 --> 01:18:25.005
And, to make your smart home
accessories

01:18:25.038 --> 01:18:27.508
work together seamlessly,
we formed an alliance

01:18:27.541 --> 01:18:28.842
with other industry leaders

01:18:28.876 --> 01:18:31.144
to create a new smart home
interoperability standard

01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:32.679
called Matter.

01:18:32.713 --> 01:18:34.448
It leverages the HomeKit
technology

01:18:34.481 --> 01:18:36.016
we open-sourced last year,

01:18:36.049 --> 01:18:37.718
and we're excited to announce

01:18:37.751 --> 01:18:40.854
that support is coming
in iOS 15.

01:18:40.888 --> 01:18:43.257
You can control HomeKit
and Matter-enabled accessories

01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:44.224
with the Home app.

01:18:44.258 --> 01:18:46.660
It's available across
your Apple devices,

01:18:46.693 --> 01:18:49.563
and this year,
we're making it even better

01:18:49.596 --> 01:18:51.765
on Apple Watch.

01:18:54.468 --> 01:18:57.137
You can tap Intercom
to broadcast a message

01:18:57.171 --> 01:18:58.438
or quickly access
the accessories

01:18:58.472 --> 01:19:00.841
you're most likely
to need in that moment.

01:19:00.874 --> 01:19:03.510
You can even see what's going on
around the house.

01:19:03.544 --> 01:19:05.646
With the HomeKit-enabled
doorbell,

01:19:05.679 --> 01:19:07.247
it's easy to see
who's at the door

01:19:07.281 --> 01:19:09.516
and greet them
right from your wrist.

01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:12.486
HomeKit Secure Video uses
the on-device intelligence

01:19:12.519 --> 01:19:14.855
of your Apple TV or HomePod mini

01:19:14.888 --> 01:19:17.424
to alert you when people,
animals, or vehicles

01:19:17.457 --> 01:19:18.692
are detected.

01:19:18.725 --> 01:19:21.528
And this year,
we're adding Package Detection

01:19:21.562 --> 01:19:24.898
so you know when a package
has arrived.

01:19:24.932 --> 01:19:26.133
And we're adding new ways

01:19:26.166 --> 01:19:28.769
to take advantage of your
cameras on Apple TV.

01:19:28.802 --> 01:19:30.137
While viewing a camera,

01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:32.539
you'll now be able to control
nearby accessories

01:19:32.573 --> 01:19:34.908
such as turning on
the outdoor lights.

01:19:34.942 --> 01:19:36.610
And you can even display
multiple cameras

01:19:36.643 --> 01:19:39.279
at the same time,
giving you a more complete view

01:19:39.313 --> 01:19:41.448
of what's happening
around the house.

01:19:41.481 --> 01:19:43.283
Those are just some of
the great experiences

01:19:43.317 --> 01:19:45.452
we're bringing to the home
this fall.

01:19:45.485 --> 01:19:47.988
With incredible new features
like Home Keys,

01:19:48.021 --> 01:19:49.723
SharePlay for shared viewing,

01:19:49.756 --> 01:19:52.526
and access to Siri in more
places than ever before,

01:19:52.559 --> 01:19:54.962
your smart home has never been
more capable.

01:19:55.529 --> 01:19:56.864

01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:12.880
[Craig] Let's talk about macOS.

01:20:12.913 --> 01:20:17.851
macOS has always been about the
fusion of power and simplicity.

01:20:17.885 --> 01:20:19.086
And with our current release,

01:20:19.119 --> 01:20:22.723
macOS Big Sur,
we introduced a bold new design

01:20:22.756 --> 01:20:26.493
that gives users more control
and huge updates for apps--

01:20:26.527 --> 01:20:29.596
all while making everything
easier to use.

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:31.965
And when combined
with the M1 chip,

01:20:31.999 --> 01:20:35.135
Big Sur delivers unmatched
levels of performance

01:20:35.169 --> 01:20:36.436
and battery life.

01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:39.106
With people using the Mac
more than ever,

01:20:39.139 --> 01:20:43.043
macOS has become an even
bigger part of our daily lives.

01:20:43.076 --> 01:20:45.879
And our next release
is focused on helping you

01:20:45.913 --> 01:20:48.015
do even more.

01:20:48.048 --> 01:20:49.483
But what should we call it?

01:20:49.516 --> 01:20:52.319
Well, that brings us
to the latest exploits

01:20:52.352 --> 01:20:54.121
of our crack marketing team.

01:20:54.154 --> 01:20:56.623
With their annual vision quest
postponed,

01:20:56.657 --> 01:20:58.325
our merry band of nomadic namers

01:20:58.358 --> 01:21:01.128
wandered aimlessly
through the California hills

01:21:01.161 --> 01:21:02.930
before donning
their technicolor wet suits

01:21:02.963 --> 01:21:05.532
and immersing themselves
in the inspiration

01:21:05.566 --> 01:21:08.535
of the beautiful, rich waters
of Monterey.

01:21:08.569 --> 01:21:10.537
macOS Monterey
gives you the power

01:21:10.571 --> 01:21:12.573
to accomplish more than ever

01:21:12.606 --> 01:21:16.376
and helps you work fluidly
across all your devices.

01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:18.478
The incredible features
we talked about earlier

01:21:18.512 --> 01:21:21.515
are going to be great
for the ways you work on Mac,

01:21:21.548 --> 01:21:23.851
like the new capabilities
in FaceTime

01:21:23.884 --> 01:21:26.019
which help you look
and sound your best

01:21:26.053 --> 01:21:28.255
while talking to coworkers
or friends.

01:21:28.288 --> 01:21:30.757
With SharePlay,
it's just plain awesome

01:21:30.791 --> 01:21:32.392
to watch movies and shows
together

01:21:32.426 --> 01:21:34.661
on your stunning Mac display

01:21:34.695 --> 01:21:37.931
or share an app window
as you collaborate on a project.

01:21:37.965 --> 01:21:40.667
Shared with You
offers a totally new way

01:21:40.701 --> 01:21:43.670
to discover photos,
articles and more

01:21:43.704 --> 01:21:45.672
that people share with you
over Messages

01:21:45.706 --> 01:21:47.307
right in your Mac apps.

01:21:47.341 --> 01:21:49.443
And when you're working hard
on a Mac,

01:21:49.476 --> 01:21:52.813
you can choose a Focus that
syncs across all your devices,

01:21:52.846 --> 01:21:55.148
helping reduce
distracting notifications

01:21:55.182 --> 01:21:57.317
so you can get the job done.

01:21:57.351 --> 01:21:59.253
Plus, Quick Note and Notes

01:21:59.286 --> 01:22:01.788
give you versatile new ways
to capture

01:22:01.822 --> 01:22:03.457
and organize your thoughts.

01:22:03.490 --> 01:22:06.994
These powerful features
are just fantastic on the Mac.

01:22:07.027 --> 01:22:09.096
And we have even more
new features

01:22:09.129 --> 01:22:12.466
that make it easier to work
across all your devices,

01:22:12.499 --> 01:22:14.868
starting with Continuity.

01:22:14.902 --> 01:22:18.572
Every device we make
is powerful in its own way,

01:22:18.605 --> 01:22:20.207
and when you use them together

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.545
you unlock new experiences
that feel truly magical.

01:22:24.578 --> 01:22:27.114
This year, we've created
a completely new way

01:22:27.147 --> 01:22:28.282
to work across your devices

01:22:28.315 --> 01:22:31.285
with greater precision
and speed, and we call it--

01:22:31.318 --> 01:22:33.353
Universal Control.

01:22:33.387 --> 01:22:34.788
With Universal Control,

01:22:34.821 --> 01:22:37.424
you can now use a single mouse
and keyboard

01:22:37.457 --> 01:22:39.459
to move between your Mac
and iPad

01:22:39.493 --> 01:22:41.461
for a seamless experience.

01:22:41.495 --> 01:22:43.864
Universal Control
is so incredible,

01:22:43.897 --> 01:22:46.099
you just have to see it
in action.

01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:48.001
Let me show it to you now.

01:22:48.669 --> 01:22:50.838
I'm putting the final touches
on an illustration

01:22:50.871 --> 01:22:52.606
here on my iPad.

01:22:52.639 --> 01:22:54.575
It's the last piece I need
to finish a presentation

01:22:54.608 --> 01:22:57.110
that I have open
on my MacBook.

01:22:57.144 --> 01:23:01.114
Now, I'll just set my iPad
down next to my Mac,

01:23:01.148 --> 01:23:02.549
and check this out.

01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:04.218
Without any other setup,

01:23:04.251 --> 01:23:06.720
I'm gonna simply move
my Mac cursor

01:23:06.753 --> 01:23:08.121
towards my iPad,

01:23:08.155 --> 01:23:10.724
and the iPad automatically
recognizes it.

01:23:10.757 --> 01:23:12.626
And if I move a bit further,

01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:15.963
boom--my cursor is now
on the iPad.

01:23:15.996 --> 01:23:17.698
How cool is that?

01:23:17.731 --> 01:23:21.435
And now I can move my cursor
back and forth effortlessly

01:23:21.468 --> 01:23:23.337
between the two.

01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:25.472
Now, it's easy to control
my iPad

01:23:25.506 --> 01:23:28.342
with just the keyboard
and trackpad on my Mac.

01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:31.278
For instance, I can click
and close this document,

01:23:31.311 --> 01:23:33.580
and flick on my trackpad

01:23:33.614 --> 01:23:35.949
to return to my iPad
home screen.

01:23:35.983 --> 01:23:39.219
And of course, I can swipe
between my pages of apps,

01:23:39.253 --> 01:23:41.388
And I can use
my MacBook's keyboard

01:23:41.421 --> 01:23:44.925
to open Spotlight
and, say, launch Notes.

01:23:44.958 --> 01:23:47.027
And I can even use command-tab

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:49.096
to switch right back
to Procreate.

01:23:49.129 --> 01:23:50.931
This is really powerful.

01:23:50.964 --> 01:23:52.266
With Universal Control,

01:23:52.299 --> 01:23:55.869
I can even drag and drop files
between my devices.

01:23:55.903 --> 01:23:59.206
I'm just gonna take this drawing
I finished on my iPad

01:23:59.239 --> 01:24:02.943
and drop it into my Keynote
on my Mac.

01:24:03.443 --> 01:24:04.711
Awesome.

01:24:04.745 --> 01:24:06.146
For our pros out there,

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:09.750
Universal Control works
with more than two devices.

01:24:09.783 --> 01:24:13.153
So let's add this iMac
to the mix.

01:24:13.187 --> 01:24:16.089
Now I can use the trackpad
on my MacBook

01:24:16.123 --> 01:24:19.626
to control my iMac as well.

01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:22.896
I can also switch
to my iMac's keyboard and mouse.

01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:24.965
This is so cool.
Watch this.

01:24:24.998 --> 01:24:27.868
Now, I have a title text image
I've been working on here

01:24:27.901 --> 01:24:30.337
in Procreate on my iPad.

01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:31.672
Now I'm gonna take this image

01:24:31.705 --> 01:24:35.576
and drag it across
all three devices

01:24:35.609 --> 01:24:39.980
and drop it into FinalCut.

01:24:40.013 --> 01:24:42.416
Just like that.

01:24:42.449 --> 01:24:44.685
Let's see the final product.

01:24:44.718 --> 01:24:46.119
Nice.

01:24:46.153 --> 01:24:49.156
That's a quick look
at Universal Control

01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:51.225
on macOS Monterey.

01:24:52.326 --> 01:24:54.461
Universal Control
makes it effortless

01:24:54.494 --> 01:24:55.929
to move between your devices

01:24:55.963 --> 01:24:58.699
so you can be more productive
and focus your energy

01:24:58.732 --> 01:25:00.601
on the task at hand.

01:25:00.634 --> 01:25:02.836
Another way our devices
work great together

01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:04.605
is with AirPlay.

01:25:04.638 --> 01:25:07.307
We all love the way AirPlay
lets us watch a movie

01:25:07.341 --> 01:25:08.509
or share a presentation

01:25:08.542 --> 01:25:11.245
from your iPhone to a TV
just like that.

01:25:11.278 --> 01:25:14.348
But there's another screen
with its stunning Retina display

01:25:14.381 --> 01:25:17.217
that makes everything you watch
simply amazing.

01:25:17.251 --> 01:25:18.752
That's why we're introducing

01:25:18.785 --> 01:25:20.954
AirPlay to Mac.

01:25:20.988 --> 01:25:23.090
It works just like AirPlay
today,

01:25:23.123 --> 01:25:25.058
so it's instantly familiar.

01:25:25.092 --> 01:25:28.529
You can play, present,
and share just about anything.

01:25:28.562 --> 01:25:30.430
As you draw a sketch on iPad,

01:25:30.464 --> 01:25:33.534
your colleagues can follow along
on the bigger display.

01:25:33.567 --> 01:25:37.037
And you can even take advantage
of any Mac's high-fidelity sound

01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:40.007
by using it as an AirPlay
speaker.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.877
AirPlay brings your Mac to life
in whole new ways.

01:25:43.911 --> 01:25:45.412
With macOS Monterey,

01:25:45.445 --> 01:25:47.915
your devices work together
like never before,

01:25:47.948 --> 01:25:50.551
making it more fluid
to work across them.

01:25:50.584 --> 01:25:53.854
And we're not just reinventing
how you work between devices.

01:25:53.887 --> 01:25:56.223
We're also giving you powerful
new tools

01:25:56.256 --> 01:25:59.259
to get more work done
on your devices.

01:25:59.293 --> 01:26:02.429
The Mac has a long, deep history
of automation

01:26:02.462 --> 01:26:04.264
with Command line,
shell scripts,

01:26:04.298 --> 01:26:06.266
AppleScript, and Automator.

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:09.636
And on iOS, we've made
automation even easier

01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:10.637
with Shortcuts.

01:26:10.671 --> 01:26:14.107
Shortcuts takes all the taps
and swipes you usually need

01:26:14.141 --> 01:26:15.542
to order your favorite lunch

01:26:15.576 --> 01:26:17.711
and makes it as simple
as tapping a button

01:26:17.744 --> 01:26:19.446
or asking Siri.

01:26:19.479 --> 01:26:22.916
Shortcuts is all about
helping you get more done--

01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:23.817
faster.

01:26:23.851 --> 01:26:26.787
Because you can let your device
do the work for you.

01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:30.691
And this year, we're bringing
Shortcuts to the Mac.

01:26:30.724 --> 01:26:32.326
The Mac is, after all,

01:26:32.359 --> 01:26:34.361
where we turn for so much
of our creative work.

01:26:34.394 --> 01:26:36.864
And now you can automate
the everyday stuff

01:26:36.897 --> 01:26:39.299
to achieve peak productivity.

01:26:39.333 --> 01:26:42.469
You get access to a rich gallery
of pre-built shortcuts

01:26:42.503 --> 01:26:44.638
designed just for Mac.

01:26:44.671 --> 01:26:47.374
You can set up a shortcut to
instantly share selected files

01:26:47.407 --> 01:26:49.943
with your friends
so they never miss a moment.

01:26:49.977 --> 01:26:51.612
And with the Shortcuts Editor,

01:26:51.645 --> 01:26:53.981
you can easily link together
a series of actions

01:26:54.014 --> 01:26:57.284
to design shortcuts
for your specific workflows.

01:26:57.317 --> 01:26:58.952
For instance,
if you're a designer,

01:26:58.986 --> 01:27:00.654
get right to work
with a shortcut

01:27:00.687 --> 01:27:02.589
that opens Pinterest
in one window,

01:27:02.623 --> 01:27:04.191
Affinity Photo in another,

01:27:04.224 --> 01:27:06.894
and starts your favorite
playlist in Apple Music.

01:27:06.927 --> 01:27:08.462
All in one click.

01:27:08.495 --> 01:27:10.998
We've weaved Shortcuts
throughout macOS,

01:27:11.031 --> 01:27:13.467
so you can run them
no matter what app is open.

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.636
They're in Finder, the Menu Bar,

01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:17.504
Spotlight, and of course,

01:27:17.538 --> 01:27:20.307
you can ask Siri to run them
hands-free.

01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:23.443
Shortcuts is the future
of automation on Mac,

01:27:23.477 --> 01:27:26.914
and this is just the start
of a multi-year transition.

01:27:26.947 --> 01:27:29.449
Automator will continue
to be supported,

01:27:29.483 --> 01:27:32.452
and you can import Automator
workflows into Shortcuts

01:27:32.486 --> 01:27:34.855
beginning day one.

01:27:34.888 --> 01:27:37.157
With Shortcuts,
there are more ways than ever

01:27:37.191 --> 01:27:39.293
to create, express yourself,

01:27:39.326 --> 01:27:41.328
and get stuff done.

01:27:41.361 --> 01:27:43.931
Finally, we have some
really big news

01:27:43.964 --> 01:27:46.800
about an app that's central
to the Mac experience--

01:27:46.834 --> 01:27:48.101
Safari.

01:27:48.135 --> 01:27:50.237
We built Safari
from the very beginning

01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:53.240
to provide the best
browsing experience on Mac,

01:27:53.273 --> 01:27:57.644
and it continues to blow the
competition out of the water.

01:27:57.678 --> 01:28:00.347
Safari is the world's fastest
browser.

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:03.283
It makes navigating
even the most complex websites

01:28:03.317 --> 01:28:04.985
lightning fast.

01:28:05.018 --> 01:28:08.555
And Safari is known for its
legendary power efficiency.

01:28:08.589 --> 01:28:10.524
On an M1 MacBook Pro,

01:28:10.557 --> 01:28:14.494
Safari users can get
up to 17 hours of browsing

01:28:14.528 --> 01:28:17.164
And of course,
Safari sets the bar

01:28:17.197 --> 01:28:19.032
for user privacy on the web

01:28:19.066 --> 01:28:20.934
with features like
Privacy Report

01:28:20.968 --> 01:28:23.470
and Intelligent Tracking
Prevention.

01:28:23.504 --> 01:28:27.407
Our users are doing more in
the browser than ever before--

01:28:27.441 --> 01:28:31.245
work, school, shopping,
and entertainment.

01:28:31.278 --> 01:28:34.481
And that often leaves them
with a lot of tabs, windows,

01:28:34.515 --> 01:28:36.116
and other distractions.

01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:38.952
We think using the browser
should feel natural

01:28:38.986 --> 01:28:40.521
and uncluttered,

01:28:40.554 --> 01:28:43.123
so we've reimagined
the browsing experience.

01:28:43.156 --> 01:28:46.026
We distilled the toolbar
to is essential elements.

01:28:46.059 --> 01:28:48.962
Tabs are more compact,
modern, and lightweight.

01:28:48.996 --> 01:28:51.498
And there's a completely
new way to use tabs

01:28:51.532 --> 01:28:52.933
with Tab Groups.

01:28:52.966 --> 01:28:56.036
They allow you to easily save
and manage your tabs

01:28:56.069 --> 01:28:59.606
without cluttering up
your tab bar.

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:03.443
I'll hand it over to Beth
to show it in action.

01:29:03.477 --> 01:29:04.378
[Beth] Thanks, Craig.

01:29:04.411 --> 01:29:05.913
Let's start with Safari's

01:29:05.946 --> 01:29:07.347
gorgeous new tab design.

01:29:07.381 --> 01:29:11.318
All of my tabs are right here
in the new streamlined tab bar.

01:29:11.351 --> 01:29:13.453
One of the really cool things
we did this year

01:29:13.487 --> 01:29:16.990
is we built the search field
right into the active tab.

01:29:17.024 --> 01:29:19.092
Safari is more space efficient
than ever,

01:29:19.126 --> 01:29:21.061
and I can see more of the page.

01:29:21.094 --> 01:29:24.131
I can click on the active tab
to see the page's full address,

01:29:24.164 --> 01:29:26.967
and then I can search
right from here.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.136
Reader is in the tab bar
whenever I need it,

01:29:29.169 --> 01:29:31.905
and everything else is
right here in the More menu.

01:29:31.939 --> 01:29:34.041
Check this out.
As I switch tabs,

01:29:34.074 --> 01:29:36.810
the tab bar takes on the color
of the site that I'm viewing,

01:29:36.844 --> 01:29:39.146
so it feels like
a part of the page.

01:29:39.179 --> 01:29:41.081
It looks beautiful.

01:29:41.648 --> 01:29:44.418
Next, I'm so excited
to tell you about Tab Groups.

01:29:44.451 --> 01:29:46.787
Tab Groups are an easy
and lightweight way

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:49.122
to save your tabs
and pick them back up later.

01:29:49.156 --> 01:29:51.258
I'll open the new
redesigned side bar,

01:29:51.291 --> 01:29:53.594
and I have a few Tab Groups
here already.

01:29:53.627 --> 01:29:56.563
Each of these groups
is a whole set of tabs.

01:29:57.865 --> 01:29:59.666
I use them for meal planning,

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:00.934
for news,

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:00.934
for news,

01:30:00.968 --> 01:30:03.136
and gift shopping.

01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:04.605
Here in my open tabs,

01:30:04.638 --> 01:30:06.273
I'm planning a road trip
to Los Angeles,

01:30:06.306 --> 01:30:07.841
and I'm not done
with my research yet.

01:30:07.875 --> 01:30:09.309
I can save these into
a Tab Group

01:30:09.343 --> 01:30:10.711
and come back to it later.

01:30:10.744 --> 01:30:13.347
I'll click the new
Tab Group button

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:16.183
and call this Trip to L.A.

01:30:17.017 --> 01:30:18.919
What's so powerful
about Tab Groups

01:30:18.952 --> 01:30:20.621
is that they're on
all of my devices.

01:30:20.654 --> 01:30:23.290
I've got my MacBook here,
and look.

01:30:23.323 --> 01:30:24.958
My new Tab Group
is here already.

01:30:24.992 --> 01:30:26.927
As I make changes
to my Tab Groups,

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.729
they update everywhere.

01:30:28.762 --> 01:30:30.597
I'm gonna open a bunch of tabs,

01:30:30.631 --> 01:30:33.100
and my iMac
just keeps up.

01:30:33.133 --> 01:30:34.935
And if I change my current tab,

01:30:34.968 --> 01:30:36.770
my Tab Group is always
up to date,

01:30:36.803 --> 01:30:38.272
and I never miss a thing.

01:30:38.305 --> 01:30:40.774
I can't wait to share
these trip ideas with my family,

01:30:40.807 --> 01:30:43.277
and I can just drag this
Tab Group into an email

01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:45.179
and send it off.

01:30:46.847 --> 01:30:48.282
Once you start using Tab Groups,

01:30:48.315 --> 01:30:50.284
we know you're going to wanna
get to them all the time.

01:30:50.317 --> 01:30:52.386
So we made it super easy
to switch from right here

01:30:52.419 --> 01:30:54.221
in the tab bar.

01:30:54.254 --> 01:30:56.323
That's the new Safari on Mac.

01:30:56.356 --> 01:30:57.558
We didn't stop there, though.

01:30:57.591 --> 01:30:59.092
Back to Craig to tell you more.

01:30:59.126 --> 01:31:00.460
[Craig] Thanks, Beth.

01:31:00.494 --> 01:31:02.829
When we were designing
the new tab experience,

01:31:02.863 --> 01:31:05.365
we wanted to build something
that worked consistently

01:31:05.399 --> 01:31:08.635
when you switch from your Mac
to your iPhone or iPad.

01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:10.737
On iPad, the new tabs
and tab bar

01:31:10.771 --> 01:31:12.840
work just like they do on Mac.

01:31:12.873 --> 01:31:15.175
Tab Groups are especially
helpful on iPad,

01:31:15.209 --> 01:31:16.510
and the instant syncing

01:31:16.543 --> 01:31:19.580
means that you can continue
a project from anywhere.

01:31:19.613 --> 01:31:23.050
On iPhone, we've done
something really special.

01:31:23.083 --> 01:31:26.787
We took all the thinking
that went into Mac and iPad

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:29.690
and pushed the envelope
even further.

01:31:29.723 --> 01:31:31.358
For this smaller screen size,

01:31:31.391 --> 01:31:33.694
we're introducing something
that's easier to reach

01:31:33.727 --> 01:31:36.296
and maximizes the page onscreen.

01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:38.832
The new tab bar appears
with just a tap

01:31:38.866 --> 01:31:40.834
and fits directly
under your thumb.

01:31:40.868 --> 01:31:44.538
And when you scroll, the bar
moves seamlessly out of the way.

01:31:44.571 --> 01:31:48.308
It's now easier and more natural
to access your other tabs too.

01:31:48.342 --> 01:31:50.310
You can just swipe over
on the tab bar

01:31:50.344 --> 01:31:52.012
to quickly move between them.

01:31:52.045 --> 01:31:53.447
Or swipe up on the tab bar

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.383
to reveal a brand-new grid view
of all your tabs

01:31:56.416 --> 01:31:57.985
plus your Tab Groups.

01:31:58.018 --> 01:31:59.620
When you get to the end
of your tabs,

01:31:59.653 --> 01:32:01.889
you can swipe again
to open a new one,

01:32:01.922 --> 01:32:05.359
and the new customizable
start page syncs with Mac

01:32:05.392 --> 01:32:09.329
so you have the same Safari
experience everywhere.

01:32:09.363 --> 01:32:11.031
There's one last feature

01:32:11.064 --> 01:32:13.100
that we're really excited
to share--

01:32:13.133 --> 01:32:14.868
Extensions.

01:32:14.902 --> 01:32:18.038
Mac users love to deeply
customize Safari

01:32:18.071 --> 01:32:19.640
with extensions like Grammarly,

01:32:19.673 --> 01:32:21.175
Honey, and Momentum.

01:32:21.208 --> 01:32:25.279
And now, we're bringing web
extensions to iPhone and iPad.

01:32:25.312 --> 01:32:28.015
Just like on Mac,
you choose what websites

01:32:28.048 --> 01:32:29.750
you want extensions
to be active on,

01:32:29.783 --> 01:32:31.785
and developers
can easily tap into

01:32:31.818 --> 01:32:33.754
and entirely new audience

01:32:33.787 --> 01:32:35.656
because these extensions
can share code

01:32:35.689 --> 01:32:37.958
with existing Safari
web extensions.

01:32:37.991 --> 01:32:41.195
This is a huge year for Safari.

01:32:41.228 --> 01:32:44.264
A totally new tab design
and Tab Groups

01:32:44.298 --> 01:32:45.532
simplify your browsing.

01:32:45.566 --> 01:32:48.202
And Safari is more customizable
than ever

01:32:48.235 --> 01:32:49.436
with the new start page

01:32:49.469 --> 01:32:52.539
and extensions on iOS
and iPadOS.

01:32:52.573 --> 01:32:53.874
And with that,

01:32:53.907 --> 01:32:56.476
we have macOS Monterey.

01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:59.413
It's a fantastic release
with great new features

01:32:59.446 --> 01:33:02.015
that help Mac users do
more than ever.

01:33:02.049 --> 01:33:04.918
You can work across
Mac and your other devices

01:33:04.952 --> 01:33:07.888
using Universal Control
and AirPlay to Mac.

01:33:07.921 --> 01:33:11.191
It's easy to get productive
and creative using Shortcuts

01:33:11.225 --> 01:33:14.061
and a totally new design
for Safari,

01:33:14.094 --> 01:33:16.864
along with incredible features
like SharePlay,

01:33:16.897 --> 01:33:19.967
Shared with You, Focus,
and Quick Note.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.002
We do have more to share
with you,

01:33:22.035 --> 01:33:25.138
but first, let's get outta here.

01:33:25.172 --> 01:33:28.175
[upbeat music]

01:33:32.946 --> 01:33:35.215
Probably should've just taken
the car.

01:33:35.249 --> 01:33:37.017
As I mentioned a moment ago,

01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:39.520
we've made incredible advances
in macOS

01:33:39.553 --> 01:33:42.356
and across all of our platforms
this year.

01:33:42.389 --> 01:33:44.925
These are going to be amazing
for users,

01:33:44.958 --> 01:33:46.827
but they also create
new opportunities

01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:48.095
for our developers,

01:33:48.128 --> 01:33:50.597
the heart and soul of WWDC.

01:33:50.631 --> 01:33:52.966
And to tell you about
the new developer features,

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.768
and technologies
we've been building

01:33:54.801 --> 01:33:57.504
to help you take your apps
to the next level,

01:33:57.538 --> 01:34:00.307
here's our VP of WWDR,

01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:03.644
Susan Prescott.

01:34:03.677 --> 01:34:05.946
[Susan] It's such a privilege
to come together

01:34:05.979 --> 01:34:07.214
with our developer community

01:34:07.247 --> 01:34:09.750
and to connect
with your creative energy.

01:34:09.783 --> 01:34:12.186
Over the course of the week,
Apple engineers

01:34:12.219 --> 01:34:14.688
are gonna share all kinds
of exciting new technologies

01:34:14.721 --> 01:34:16.690
and features that we think
you're gonna love.

01:34:16.723 --> 01:34:18.358
And there are a few
announcements

01:34:18.392 --> 01:34:20.093
that we just couldn't wait
to share--

01:34:20.127 --> 01:34:24.431
APIs that'll help you create
even more incredible apps,

01:34:24.464 --> 01:34:25.966
Swift features
that make the language

01:34:25.999 --> 01:34:28.368
both easier and more powerful,

01:34:28.402 --> 01:34:29.536
and App Store features

01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:32.172
that'll help you
better connect with users.

01:34:32.206 --> 01:34:34.141
Let's start with APIs,

01:34:34.174 --> 01:34:36.810
and there are a lot
of new APIs this year.

01:34:36.844 --> 01:34:38.879
Like the ones for SharePlay

01:34:38.912 --> 01:34:40.981
that make it possible to build
new shared experiences

01:34:41.014 --> 01:34:44.184
for iPhone, iPad, Mac,
and Apple TV.

01:34:44.218 --> 01:34:46.553
And system-level enhancements
like Voice Isolation,

01:34:46.587 --> 01:34:48.956
Wide Spectrum audio,
and Portrait Mode

01:34:48.989 --> 01:34:51.825
that can work in any
videoconferencing app.

01:34:51.859 --> 01:34:54.761
New APIs for Focus
and Notifications.

01:34:54.795 --> 01:34:57.698
A new extra-large widget size
for iPad.

01:34:57.731 --> 01:34:59.700
The Screen Time API,

01:34:59.733 --> 01:35:01.902
Always-On apps for watchOS.

01:35:01.935 --> 01:35:05.372
New advanced rendering APIs
in RealityKit.

01:35:05.405 --> 01:35:07.374
And we've gone even further
in this release

01:35:07.407 --> 01:35:09.643
to make it easy
for all developers

01:35:09.676 --> 01:35:14.014
to create realistic 3D objects
with Object Capture.

01:35:14.047 --> 01:35:16.149
Object Capture is a
revolutionary new API

01:35:16.183 --> 01:35:18.352
on macOS.

01:35:18.385 --> 01:35:22.322
Rather than manually creating
3D models which can take weeks,

01:35:22.356 --> 01:35:24.324
Object Capture
uses photogrammetry

01:35:24.358 --> 01:35:26.193
to turn a series of 2D images

01:35:26.226 --> 01:35:30.163
into photorealistic 3D objects
in just minutes.

01:35:30.197 --> 01:35:32.666
Leading developers
like Maxon and Unity

01:35:32.699 --> 01:35:34.535
are already using Object Capture

01:35:34.568 --> 01:35:37.838
to unlock entirely new ways
of creating 3D content.

01:35:37.871 --> 01:35:40.340
It's as simple as taking
photos of an object

01:35:40.374 --> 01:35:43.544
on your iPhone or iPad,

01:35:43.577 --> 01:35:45.379
then importing them
into Cinema 4D

01:35:45.412 --> 01:35:47.915
to create a lifelike 3D model.

01:35:47.948 --> 01:35:50.450
For the first time,
developers can generate

01:35:50.484 --> 01:35:51.919
an AR preview of the model

01:35:51.952 --> 01:35:54.021
to ensure they've captured
what they need

01:35:54.054 --> 01:35:55.422
while on location.

01:35:55.455 --> 01:35:57.758
And Wayfair
is using Object Capture

01:35:57.791 --> 01:35:59.960
to develop tools
for their manufacturers

01:35:59.993 --> 01:36:01.828
so they can use an iPhone
and Mac

01:36:01.862 --> 01:36:04.898
to easily create
a virtual representation

01:36:04.932 --> 01:36:07.201
of their merchandise.

01:36:07.234 --> 01:36:08.802
This will allow Wayfair users

01:36:08.836 --> 01:36:11.638
to preview more products
in their homes with AR

01:36:11.672 --> 01:36:15.843
to make sure they choose the
right product for their space.

01:36:15.876 --> 01:36:19.847
This is a massive step forward
for 3D content creation.

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.448
What used to be
the most difficult

01:36:21.481 --> 01:36:25.552
and expensive part of building
AR experiences and 3D scenes

01:36:25.586 --> 01:36:29.389
is now available to all
developers in macOs Monterey.

01:36:29.423 --> 01:36:32.993
Object Capture and all the APIs
we've talked about today

01:36:33.026 --> 01:36:36.430
are built on the Swift
programming language.

01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:39.967
Swift has made a huge impact
on our app ecosystem,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.036
and today, the majority
of the top 1,000 apps

01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:45.372
are built using Swift.

01:36:45.405 --> 01:36:47.140
To tell you about
the improvements

01:36:47.174 --> 01:36:49.443
we're making this year,
here's Ted.

01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:52.379
[Ted] Thanks, Susan.

01:36:52.412 --> 01:36:55.849
We designed Swift to make it
easy to create great apps.

01:36:55.883 --> 01:36:58.318
It has an approachable
modern syntax,

01:36:58.352 --> 01:37:00.521
incredible runtime performance,

01:37:00.554 --> 01:37:02.456
and safety features
that eliminate

01:37:02.489 --> 01:37:05.092
whole categories
of programming errors.

01:37:05.125 --> 01:37:06.593
In recent years, we've worked

01:37:06.627 --> 01:37:08.362
with the Swift open-source
community

01:37:08.395 --> 01:37:10.097
to build tons of new features

01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:13.400
that make Swift easier
and more powerful.

01:37:13.433 --> 01:37:15.536
And this year,
one of the biggest features

01:37:15.569 --> 01:37:18.805
we're building into Swift
is Concurrency.

01:37:18.839 --> 01:37:22.176
Concurrency is one of the most
requested features for Swift,

01:37:22.209 --> 01:37:23.644
and it's key to building apps

01:37:23.677 --> 01:37:25.579
that are responsive
to user input

01:37:25.612 --> 01:37:27.548
while doing work
in the background.

01:37:27.581 --> 01:37:30.217
Concurrency also makes it
dramatically easier

01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:32.586
to write code that does work
in parallel,

01:37:32.619 --> 01:37:34.588
so your app
can take full advantage

01:37:34.621 --> 01:37:36.290
of multi-core processors.

01:37:36.323 --> 01:37:39.092
Without language features
that simplify concurrency,

01:37:39.126 --> 01:37:41.195
you need to write
"asynchronous" code

01:37:41.228 --> 01:37:43.697
that's hard to write,
hard to understand,

01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:45.832
and hard to debug.

01:37:45.866 --> 01:37:47.334
Our approach to concurrency
in Swift

01:37:47.367 --> 01:37:50.437
builds on the same core
principles of Swift itself,

01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:53.273
making it easier to write fast,
modern,

01:37:53.307 --> 01:37:55.309
safe code with fewer mistakes.

01:37:55.342 --> 01:37:59.246
We built structured concurrency
deep into the Swift language

01:37:59.279 --> 01:38:02.449
and use the common
async/await pattern

01:38:02.482 --> 01:38:05.018
combined with a technology
called actors.

01:38:05.052 --> 01:38:08.088
This means you can write code
as a simple sequence of steps

01:38:08.121 --> 01:38:11.558
with actors safely isolating
parallel tasks from one another.

01:38:11.592 --> 01:38:13.894
So building code for concurrency

01:38:13.927 --> 01:38:16.396
goes from something
complicated like this

01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:19.366
to something simple like this.

01:38:19.399 --> 01:38:21.368
That kind of power
and simplicity

01:38:21.401 --> 01:38:23.337
is what Swift is all about,

01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:26.006
and we're excited to share
more with you this week.

01:38:26.039 --> 01:38:28.075
Now, back to Susan.

01:38:30.711 --> 01:38:32.913
[Susan] We created Swift
and all these other

01:38:32.946 --> 01:38:35.482
technologies and frameworks
for one reason:

01:38:35.516 --> 01:38:37.951
to help you build
the best possible apps.

01:38:37.985 --> 01:38:40.053
And the best place
to discover those apps

01:38:40.087 --> 01:38:42.422
is on the App Store.

01:38:42.956 --> 01:38:45.325
To tell you about some of
the exciting features

01:38:45.359 --> 01:38:47.661
we've been working on,
here's Ann.

01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:52.032
[Ann] Since the beginning,
we designed the App Store

01:38:52.065 --> 01:38:54.168
to be a safe and trusted place.

01:38:54.201 --> 01:38:57.004
Users can just focus
on finding the right app,

01:38:57.037 --> 01:38:59.339
knowing Apple has reviewed
every app

01:38:59.373 --> 01:39:01.441
to make sure it meets
our high standards

01:39:01.475 --> 01:39:04.945
for security, privacy,
and safety.

01:39:04.978 --> 01:39:07.014
And that's why the App Store
now serves

01:39:07.047 --> 01:39:09.716
nearly 600 million
weekly visitors

01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:12.920
in 175 countries and regions,

01:39:12.953 --> 01:39:15.322
making it a great
business opportunity

01:39:15.355 --> 01:39:16.924
for all developers,

01:39:16.957 --> 01:39:19.760
and an engine for innovation
and growth.

01:39:19.793 --> 01:39:24.765
And Apple has now paid
over $230 billion to developers

01:39:24.798 --> 01:39:27.267
since the App Store launched.

01:39:27.301 --> 01:39:30.504
Today, we're introducing
some incredible new ways

01:39:30.537 --> 01:39:34.374
to help developers like you
reach even more users,

01:39:34.408 --> 01:39:36.910
starting with
the App Product Page.

01:39:36.944 --> 01:39:38.745
This year,
you'll be able to create

01:39:38.779 --> 01:39:40.914
multiple custom product pages

01:39:40.948 --> 01:39:44.718
to showcase different features
of your app for different users.

01:39:44.751 --> 01:39:47.387
You can also try out
different screenshots,

01:39:47.421 --> 01:39:49.957
videos, and even app icons

01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:52.526
to understand
what users like most.

01:39:52.559 --> 01:39:55.028
These improvements
will give you even more ways

01:39:55.062 --> 01:39:57.097
to tell the world about
your app.

01:39:57.130 --> 01:40:00.834
It's also important to showcase
the dynamic things happening

01:39:57.130 --> 01:40:00.834
It's also important to showcase
the dynamic things happening

01:40:00.868 --> 01:40:02.569
inside your apps.

01:40:02.603 --> 01:40:04.738
The most popular apps and games

01:40:04.771 --> 01:40:06.740
are constantly introducing
new content

01:40:06.773 --> 01:40:08.742
and limited-time events

01:40:08.775 --> 01:40:10.544
like Pokémon Go Fest,

01:40:10.577 --> 01:40:13.213
film premieres like
In the Heights

01:40:13.247 --> 01:40:15.482
and Nike fitness challenges.

01:40:15.516 --> 01:40:17.618
Events across
the entire app ecosystem

01:40:17.651 --> 01:40:20.821
help users find
the next big thing.

01:40:20.854 --> 01:40:24.424
This year,
we're introducing new ways

01:40:24.458 --> 01:40:27.194
to discover amazing events
like these.

01:40:27.227 --> 01:40:29.596
We call them In-App Events.

01:40:29.630 --> 01:40:32.266
With In-App Events,
the dynamic content

01:40:32.299 --> 01:40:34.368
and experiences within apps

01:40:34.401 --> 01:40:36.870
will be front and center
on the App Store

01:40:36.904 --> 01:40:38.872
so users never miss
a big moment.

01:40:38.906 --> 01:40:41.441
And this is huge for developers.

01:40:41.475 --> 01:40:43.944
In-App Events can be surfaced
throughout the store

01:40:43.977 --> 01:40:47.047
to millions of users, whether
they're brand-new to the app

01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.249
or they use it every day.

01:40:49.283 --> 01:40:52.553
You can showcase them
on your app's product page.

01:40:52.586 --> 01:40:56.156
Users can learn more,
sign up to be notified,

01:40:56.190 --> 01:40:59.293
or quickly join the action
if it's happening now.

01:40:59.326 --> 01:41:00.761
They can discover events

01:41:00.794 --> 01:41:02.629
with personalized
recommendations.

01:41:02.663 --> 01:41:04.331
And in Search.

01:41:04.364 --> 01:41:08.402
Our expert editors will curate
the best and biggest events.

01:41:08.435 --> 01:41:10.237
And the new App Store widget

01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:13.307
will feature upcoming events
right on the home screen.

01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:16.343
With In-App Events,
the App Store continues to be

01:41:16.376 --> 01:41:18.145
the best place to discover
what's happening

01:41:18.178 --> 01:41:19.980
in apps and games.

01:41:20.013 --> 01:41:22.216
And this will be open
to all developers,

01:41:22.249 --> 01:41:23.750
whether they already
have events,

01:41:23.784 --> 01:41:25.819
or they're just getting started.

01:41:25.853 --> 01:41:27.855
And now I'll hand it back
to Susan.

01:41:29.690 --> 01:41:31.859
[Susan] There's something else
we're doing this year,

01:41:31.892 --> 01:41:33.527
and it's going to take
app development

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:34.928
to the next level.

01:41:34.962 --> 01:41:37.798
It integrates the Cloud
with our developer tools

01:41:37.831 --> 01:41:41.301
in a powerful new way,
and it's called...

01:41:41.335 --> 01:41:43.136
Xcode Cloud.

01:41:43.170 --> 01:41:45.939
Today, creating an app requires
multiple steps--

01:41:45.973 --> 01:41:48.242
building, testing,
and delivery--

01:41:48.275 --> 01:41:49.910
and a number of different tools.

01:41:49.943 --> 01:41:53.046
Xcode Cloud
simplifies the workflow

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.082
by bringing everything together,

01:41:55.115 --> 01:41:56.984
so as an individual developer,

01:41:57.017 --> 01:41:59.253
you can focus your energy
on being creative

01:41:59.286 --> 01:42:02.523
and development teams can
collaborate more effectively.

01:42:02.556 --> 01:42:04.391
Here's how it works.

01:42:04.424 --> 01:42:06.727
When you commit a change
to your code,

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:09.363
Xcode Cloud can automatically
build the app.

01:42:09.396 --> 01:42:11.231
Because it's built in the Cloud,

01:42:11.265 --> 01:42:13.333
your Mac is free
for other tasks.

01:42:13.367 --> 01:42:15.402
And for teams,
everyone can see

01:42:15.435 --> 01:42:16.837
if the change introduces errors,

01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:20.073
so everyone can find
and fix issues faster.

01:42:20.107 --> 01:42:24.178
Then Xcode Cloud runs
your automated tests in parallel

01:42:24.211 --> 01:42:26.413
so they complete
in a fraction of the time

01:42:26.446 --> 01:42:28.081
even as they simulate running

01:42:28.115 --> 01:42:31.018
on every kind of Apple device
and platform.

01:42:31.051 --> 01:42:34.188
And the test results
are displayed in Xcode,

01:42:34.221 --> 01:42:36.223
so you can easily see
what worked

01:42:36.256 --> 01:42:38.125
and fix what didn't.

01:42:38.158 --> 01:42:40.961
Finally, once the app
passes all its tests,

01:42:40.994 --> 01:42:43.497
Xcode Cloud can automatically
distribute it

01:42:43.530 --> 01:42:45.032
to the testers on your team,

01:42:45.065 --> 01:42:48.335
and even external beta testers,
with TestFlight.

01:42:48.368 --> 01:42:51.405
And all of these essential
continuous integration

01:42:51.438 --> 01:42:54.975
and delivery features
are right there in Xcode.

01:42:55.008 --> 01:42:57.511
So you can work
without switching tools

01:42:57.544 --> 01:42:59.279
and you can stay focused
on your code.

01:42:59.313 --> 01:43:02.716
Xcode Cloud is the quickest,
easiest way

01:43:02.749 --> 01:43:05.485
to build, test, and deliver
your apps.

01:43:05.519 --> 01:43:07.454
And it's built with
advanced security

01:43:07.487 --> 01:43:09.957
to protect you
and your projects.

01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:12.926
Your source code is only used in
a temporary build environment,

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.429
and the only things
Xcode Cloud stores

01:43:15.462 --> 01:43:17.431
are the products of the build.

01:43:17.464 --> 01:43:19.299
Xcode Cloud and TestFlight

01:43:19.333 --> 01:43:21.768
make it easy to distribute betas
to users

01:43:21.802 --> 01:43:25.072
on iPhone, iPad,
Apple Watch, and Apple TV,

01:43:25.105 --> 01:43:27.741
and we want Xcode Cloud
to be able

01:43:27.774 --> 01:43:29.610
to automatically distribute
beta apps

01:43:29.643 --> 01:43:31.545
across all Apple platforms.

01:43:31.578 --> 01:43:33.380
To make that happen,

01:43:33.413 --> 01:43:36.149
we're bringing TestFlight
to the Mac.

01:43:36.183 --> 01:43:39.086
So you can use TestFlight
to easily test your Mac apps,

01:43:39.119 --> 01:43:41.421
including features like
In-app purchases.

01:43:41.455 --> 01:43:44.024
Xcode Cloud
is incredibly powerful,

01:43:44.057 --> 01:43:46.226
and we can't wait
for you to use it

01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:50.197
and see how it'll help you
build better apps faster.

01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:54.368
We'll be providing access
to a limited beta starting today

01:43:54.401 --> 01:43:56.737
and expanding access
to this free beta

01:43:56.770 --> 01:43:58.238
throughout the summer and fall.

01:43:58.272 --> 01:44:00.240
And Xcode Cloud
will be available

01:44:00.274 --> 01:44:02.209
to all developers next year.

01:44:02.242 --> 01:44:05.045
We'll provide more details
on pricing and availability

01:44:05.078 --> 01:44:06.346
this fall.

01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:09.049
We're really excited about
these announcements,

01:44:09.082 --> 01:44:11.118
and these are just
some of the highlights.

01:44:11.151 --> 01:44:13.253
We continue to innovate
with the App Store

01:44:13.287 --> 01:44:15.722
and tools and technologies
to help you

01:44:15.756 --> 01:44:17.624
do extraordinary things.

01:44:17.658 --> 01:44:19.259
And we're gonna be telling you
even more

01:44:19.293 --> 01:44:21.161
in sessions throughout the week.

01:44:21.195 --> 01:44:23.397
Now, back to Tim.

01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:25.132
But first...
[snaps]

01:44:25.165 --> 01:44:27.000
Much better.

01:44:27.034 --> 01:44:29.002
Take it home, Tim.

01:44:29.036 --> 01:44:31.572
[Tim] Thank you, Susan.
And thank you, Craig.

01:44:31.605 --> 01:44:33.707
And thanks to all of
our presenters.

01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:36.043
What a big day of announcements
and innovations

01:44:36.076 --> 01:44:38.545
for our users
and our developers.

01:44:39.346 --> 01:44:41.048
We took giant steps forward

01:44:41.081 --> 01:44:43.050
with all of our software
platforms,

01:44:43.083 --> 01:44:45.252
and they will enable our users
and developers

01:44:45.285 --> 01:44:47.154
to do remarkable things.

01:44:47.187 --> 01:44:49.756
Our OS releases
will be available

01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:52.259
as developer betas today.

01:44:52.292 --> 01:44:56.430
And each of them will have
a public beta next month.

01:44:56.463 --> 01:44:59.032
And all of this
incredible software

01:44:59.066 --> 01:45:02.836
will be available
to all of our users this fall.

01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:05.873
I'm so excited
for these new releases

01:45:05.906 --> 01:45:09.042
and how they will make
our products even more powerful

01:45:09.076 --> 01:45:10.410
and more capable.

01:45:10.444 --> 01:45:13.814
They will provide users new ways
to enrich their lives

01:45:13.847 --> 01:45:16.617
and developers new tools
to change the world.

01:45:16.650 --> 01:45:19.119
We hope you've enjoyed
today's event

01:45:19.152 --> 01:45:21.688
and that you're excited
for the week ahead.

01:45:21.722 --> 01:45:24.458
For those developers who want
to take a deeper dive

01:45:24.491 --> 01:45:25.726
into our announcements,

01:45:25.759 --> 01:45:27.628
we have the
Platforms State of the Union

01:45:27.661 --> 01:45:29.963
coming up later today.

01:45:29.997 --> 01:45:33.066
And we have a week full
of in-depth sessions

01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:35.536
and one-to-one labs
with Apple engineers.

01:45:36.103 --> 01:45:39.473
We will also provide Pavilions,
Daily Recaps,

01:45:39.506 --> 01:45:40.807
and other experiences

01:45:40.841 --> 01:45:43.477
to help you get the most
out of the conference.

01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:46.680
Thank you for joining us.
Let's have a great week!
