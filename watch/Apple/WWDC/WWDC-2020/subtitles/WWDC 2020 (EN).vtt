WEBVTT

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:04.538
["Daydreamer" by Aurora playing]

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:25.519
Good morning. And welcome to WWDC.

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:31.625
WWDC is an incredibly important event
to Apple, our developers and our users.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:35.329
It's here that we bring
some of our biggest innovations to life.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.464
And we have not stopped innovating,

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.868
doing the work that will enrich
people's lives for years to come.

00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:44.738
Because we're all looking forward
to a more hopeful tomorrow.

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:49.209
That's why we believe it's so important
to have WWDC this year.

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:52.813
And while it cannot possibly
feel the same in here without you,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.450
I can assure you
that we have a great show ahead of us.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.820
This year we're delivering the conference
in a whole new way

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:03.123
to all of you around the world,
directly to your home.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.493
And we want to welcome you
to our home here at Apple Park.

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.696
I'd like to first talk to you
about two big things

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:11.765
that are happening in the world right now.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:17.938
To start, I want to address the topic
of racism, inequality and injustice

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:21.742
and to recognize the pain being felt
throughout our nation,

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.511
especially in
our Black and Brown communities,

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:27.080
after the senseless killing
of George Floyd.

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:31.218
And while the events of this past month
are sadly not new,

00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:32.452
they have caused us to face

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.690
long-standing institutional inequalities
and social injustices.

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:41.395
This country was founded on the principles
of freedom and equality for all.

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.200
For too many people and for too long,
we haven't lived up to those ideals.

00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:48.302
We're inspired and moved

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:51.805
by the passionate people around our nation
and around the world

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.941
who have stood up to demand change.

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:59.746
We must all aim far higher to build
a future that lives up to our ideals.

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:01.849
This means taking action.

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:07.154
Two weeks ago, we announced Apple's
Racial Equity and Justice Initiative

00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:09.790
with a commitment
of one hundred million dollars.

00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:13.694
Starting in the United States,
and expanding over time,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.263
this initiative will challenge
systemic barriers

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.132
that limit opportunity
for communities of color

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:24.605
in the critical areas of education,
economic equality and criminal justice.

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:28.809
We also announced something important
for this community,

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:32.346
the new Developer Entrepreneur Camp
for Black developers.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:37.684
We want to do everything we can to foster
the brightest lights and best ideas.

00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:42.623
At Apple, our mission has always been
to make the world a better place,

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.292
and we're committed
to being a force for change.

00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:48.762
Right now our world is
also battling a virus

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.899
that is affecting
the daily lives of billions of people.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:55.135
We want to thank the dedicated people
everywhere,

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:57.337
especially our health-care workers,

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:01.141
who have made tremendous sacrifices
to take care of those in need.

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.779
We've also seen the profound impact
our products have had.

00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:11.552
People are relying on them more than ever
to remain connected to family and friends,

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:14.354
to do their work,
to express their creativity,

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.124
to be entertained
as well as to entertain others.

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:20.827
Today the world is counting on all of us,

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:24.598
and on the products and experiences
that we create, to move forward.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:26.967
Because throughout history,

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:31.505
great challenges have been met with great
creativity and important breakthroughs.

00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:35.576
That's why we're so excited
about this year's conference.

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:38.045
This is going to be truly a unique week,

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.514
delivered unlike any
that we've done before.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:44.451
There will be more than a hundred
engineering-led video sessions,

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:47.087
one-on-one consultations
with Apple engineers,

00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:49.690
developer forums and so much more,

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:53.861
delivered to you from different locations
right here at Apple Park.

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:56.697
And this year,
the conference will be available

00:04:56.763 --> 00:05:00.067
to our entire community
of 23 million developers,

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:03.604
as well as anyone who is interested,
for free.

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:08.575
Presenting the conference in this way
allows us to be more inclusive than ever.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:11.979
Perhaps this will inspire
the next generation of developers.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:15.182
So even though
we can't be together in person,

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.951
in some ways we're going to be
more together than ever.

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:21.288
Today we're going to push
each of our platforms forward

00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:23.891
in some exciting and breakthrough ways.

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:26.860
With that, let's get started
by sending it over to Craig.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:37.070
Good morning. Great to have you here.

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:42.142
As you can see, we've got a lot to cover,
so let's get started with iOS.

00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:45.245
Together with iPhone,

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:49.616
iOS is central to how we navigate
our lives and stay connected.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:53.320
And now we're making it
even more powerful and easier to use.

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:56.957
Our new release is iOS 14.

00:05:57.824 --> 00:05:59.960
This year we've spent time rethinking

00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:03.864
some of the most iconic elements
of the experience on iPhone.

00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:05.365
Now it all started here,

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:09.770
with a carefully considered Home Screen
that has truly stood the test of time.

00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:13.207
Of course, over the years, we've kept
the fundamentals largely the same

00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:17.611
but carefully added features
like folders for organizing your apps,

00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:19.613
widgets for quick information

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.417
and personalized experiences
powered by on-device intelligence

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:27.087
that serve up just the right thing
at just the right moment.

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:30.357
It's hard to imagine iPhone
without these features now.

00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:32.526
Well, that brings us to this year.

00:06:32.593 --> 00:06:35.395
We're doing more on our iPhones today
than ever before,

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:39.466
so we've rethought some of
the core elements of iOS to reflect this.

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:41.335
Let me give you a quick peek.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:44.872
["Like This Like That" by
BEGINNERS & Night Panda playing]

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:21.542
This is gonna be amazing.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:24.378
Let's dig in,
starting with the Home Screen.

00:07:24.978 --> 00:07:28.582
Today's Home Screen works great,
but as we get more and more apps,

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:29.950
we can end up with this:

00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:32.085
lots and lots of pages.

00:07:32.152 --> 00:07:34.555
And we tend to forget
what's beyond the first couple.

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.023
Wouldn't it be great

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:40.093
if there were a way to organize
all of those apps without doing a thing?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.531
Well, this year we're doing just that
with something called the App Library.

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:47.267
It's a new space
at the end of your Home Screen pages

00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:49.837
that automatically organizes all your apps

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:52.873
in one simple and easy-to-navigate view.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.941
Let me show you.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.012
Here's my Home Screen.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:03.317
Now, like you, I have muscle memory built
for the first page or two,

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:05.886
but when it comes to all of these pages,

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:08.922
well, honestly, I've lost track
of where a lot of things are.

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:11.692
And that's where the App Library comes in.

00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:15.329
You can see that all of my apps
are automatically organized here.

00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:17.130
In fact, now with the App Library,

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:20.467
I actually don't need all those pages
for all my apps.

00:08:20.534 --> 00:08:23.303
So we created an easy way
to hide app pages.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.406
I just go into jiggle mode,
tap the dots at the bottom,

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:27.474
and check this out,

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:30.177
I get a zoomed-out view
of all my app pages.

00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:33.780
I can simply tap
to hide the pages I no longer need.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.449
Just like that.

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:37.551
And now with those pages hidden,

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:40.754
App Library is always
just a swipe or two away.

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:45.158
So here in App Library, getting to the app
I'm looking for is really easy.

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.761
Up at the top I have the Search field,

00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:50.831
and I get all my apps
organized from A to Z.

00:08:50.898 --> 00:08:54.468
Now over here on the upper left
I have Suggestions.

00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:56.236
It uses on-device intelligence

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:59.006
to show me the apps
that I'm likely to need next.

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:01.475
And on the right is Recently Added,

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:05.045
giving me access to the apps that I've
recently downloaded from the App Store.

00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:08.115
And below are
intelligently curated categories.

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:11.652
So I can tap into a category
like Apple Arcade

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:14.388
and see all of my apps in that category.

00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:16.056
Now let's go back.

00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:18.225
You may notice
that in each of these categories

00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:21.094
the apps I use most are right here
at the top level,

00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:25.666
so I can launch one of these directly
with just a tap.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.068
So that's App Library.

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:32.005
We think this is gonna make it
easier than ever to get to your apps.

00:09:32.506 --> 00:09:35.108
Next, let's turn to Widgets.

00:09:36.143 --> 00:09:39.012
Today, widgets help you get information
at a glance.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.648
But a lot has changed
since we first introduced these.

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:45.953
Now we have Apple Watch, where we're able
to surface so much information

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:48.355
on a small screen
that you wear on your wrist.

00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:50.824
Well, this year,
we're taking all that we've learned

00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.861
to create a completely reimagined
experience for widgets.

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:57.698
To start,
they're more beautiful and data rich.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.399
And we're introducing different sizes,

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.935
so you can choose one
that best fits your needs.

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.935
so you can choose one
that best fits your needs.

00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:05.372
Let's take a look at them in iOS 14.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.911
So let's swipe over to Today View
and take a look at our new widgets.

00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:12.279
They're just beautiful.

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:15.115
And the new designs are
more data rich than ever.

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:19.520
And you can see
they now come in a variety of sizes.

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:22.656
So you can pick just the right level
of information for each one.

00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:25.259
Now we like these new widgets so much,

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:27.561
we wanted to make them
even more accessible.

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:29.029
So check this out.

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:31.331
I'm just gonna tap and hold
on the Weather widget,

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:35.369
and I can drag it out of Today View
and onto my Home Screen.

00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:37.471
And watch, as I move it around,

00:10:37.538 --> 00:10:41.275
the apps just dance out of the way
to make space for my new widget.

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.776
Let's add a second one.

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:45.179
Just gonna tap the plus
here in the upper left

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:46.847
and grab on to Podcasts.

00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:49.116
I can drop it just like that.

00:10:49.183 --> 00:10:53.620
Now I'm gonna swipe over to page 2 here
and bring back up the Widget Gallery.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.490
The gallery is a great place
to explore widgets.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.759
Now when I tap on one,

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.930
I can actually page through
all of the different sizes available.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.097
Just like this.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.100
But, you know, right now what I want to do
is grab this widget up top.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.970
It's a really special one.
It's called the Smart Stack.

00:11:10.037 --> 00:11:12.306
Just gonna tap it and drop it here.

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:16.577
With the Smart Stack,
I can easily swipe through widgets

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:19.513
to pick just the one I want
for the moment.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.348
But what's really cool

00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:26.253
is that the Smart Stack can
actually do this for me automatically.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.356
So in the morning,
I can get my news briefing.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.026
Throughout the day,
find out when I have a meeting coming up.

00:11:33.427 --> 00:11:36.430
And in the evening, I might get
a summary of my activity for the day.

00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:39.066
So that's widgets on the Home Screen.

00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:42.803
We're excited to see how everyone
will customize them in their own way.

00:11:43.237 --> 00:11:46.940
Next, we're also bringing
Picture in Picture to iPhone.

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:49.643
So you can access apps on your iPhone

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.846
while watching video
or talking on a FaceTime call.

00:11:53.347 --> 00:11:54.481
Let me show you.

00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:56.183
So here on my Home Screen,

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.085
the Smart Stack
is showing me the TV widget.

00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:00.721
So I can just tap to start playing a show.

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:04.091
Now check this out.
When I swipe to go Home,

00:12:04.157 --> 00:12:06.927
the video automatically goes
into Picture in Picture

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:08.295
right over the Home Screen.

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:13.233
And when I launch another app, like Notes,
I can keep watching.

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:17.437
Now I can drag the picture
to another part of the screen.

00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:20.674
If I want to make it bigger,
I can even pinch to zoom.

00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:24.545
And as I move between applications
it stays with me.

00:12:24.878 --> 00:12:28.148
And what's cool is
I can also swipe it to the side,

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:31.285
and the audio keeps playing
when it's off-screen.

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:35.556
Now here on the Home Screen
I can bring it back out if I want.

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:39.293
And I have controls
to get back to full-screen playback,

00:12:39.693 --> 00:12:42.863
or I can just tap the "X" to close it.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.499
And that's Picture in Picture video.

00:12:45.566 --> 00:12:48.235
It's a great way
to continue enjoying your video

00:12:48.302 --> 00:12:51.638
while tapping into everything else
your iPhone can do for you.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:56.376
And that's a quick look at the updates
to the core elements of iOS.

00:12:56.443 --> 00:13:00.080
We think these new features are gonna
make iOS even more helpful in the moment.

00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:04.585
Another iconic experience
that's getting a major update is Siri.

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:08.355
As much as Siri has advanced
over the years,

00:13:08.422 --> 00:13:12.459
the visual interface for interacting
with it has remained largely unchanged.

00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:15.796
When you use Siri, your iPhone
switches to this full-screen UI,

00:13:15.863 --> 00:13:17.464
obscuring your current context.

00:13:17.931 --> 00:13:21.335
So this year, we've completely redesigned
the Siri experience

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:23.003
with a new compact design.

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:26.540
It makes tasks like launching apps
incredibly seamless.

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:29.243
For example, if you say, "Open Safari,"

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:33.013
Siri pops up at the bottom of the screen
and instantly launches the app.

00:13:33.514 --> 00:13:35.782
Or if you ask for information,
like the weather,

00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:39.453
results appear at the top of the screen
just like a notification.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.321
Now this is especially great

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:43.757
when there's information
you want to reference on-screen.

00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:46.827
For example, you could ask Siri
to add to your grocery list.

00:13:47.728 --> 00:13:51.465
So that's the new Siri design in iOS 14.

00:13:51.532 --> 00:13:54.134
But the UI is only part of the story.

00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:57.204
To tell you more about
how we're making Siri smarter than ever,

00:13:57.538 --> 00:13:59.506
I'll hand it off to Yael Garten.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.275
Thanks, Craig.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:04.511
Siri's getting smarter
and even more helpful every day,

00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:06.880
and I'm really excited to share
the latest updates with you.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.750
Siri helps you in a ton of little ways
every day:

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:13.854
playing the morning news,
ordering a coffee, getting directions,

00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:16.924
setting the alarm before going to bed
and so much more.

00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:20.093
In fact, Siri's helping so many of you

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.930
with a staggering 25 billion requests
each month.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.899
And Siri's getting more helpful every day.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.502
Siri's always been great
for getting information

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:31.939
and now has over 20 times more facts
than just three years ago.

00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:33.674
For more complex questions

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.411
like "How do hybrid cars work?"
or "What causes seasons?",

00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:40.981
we recently introduced answers
from websites across the Internet,

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:43.851
enabling Siri to help you
find even more answers.

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:48.555
Another way Siri helps is
with communication, like sending messages.

00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:52.025
This year, you can now ask Siri
to send an audio message,

00:14:52.092 --> 00:14:53.560
and Siri will start recording.

00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:57.664
This is great when you really want to have
the emotion of your voice come through.

00:14:58.232 --> 00:15:01.568
Another popular way to send messages
with your voice is using dictation.

00:15:01.969 --> 00:15:05.372
Keyboard Dictation uses
the same speech recognition as Siri.

00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:08.642
And leveraging
the power of the Neural Engine,

00:15:08.709 --> 00:15:11.578
we are now able
to run dictation on-device.

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:14.848
This provides great accuracy and privacy.

00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:19.853
When communicating with someone in another
language, Siri can help with translations.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.624
This year we're expanding
to support many new language pairs.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.058
This is hugely popular,

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:28.195
but we know our users want
more than just translating phrases.

00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:30.464
They want to have entire conversations.

00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:32.966
And we believe conversations
between languages

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:37.304
should feel natural and easy
and have the ability to stay private.

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:41.241
That's why we're introducing
a new app called Translate.

00:15:42.176 --> 00:15:46.280
It is designed to be the best
and easiest-to-use app for conversations.

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:50.517
And it can work completely off-line,
keeping your conversations private.

00:15:51.018 --> 00:15:54.621
Using advanced on-device machine learning
and the powerful Neural Engine,

00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:56.657
you can translate your text and voice

00:15:56.723 --> 00:15:59.393
between any combination
of these 11 languages.

00:15:59.893 --> 00:16:02.729
So I could have a conversation
with someone in Mandarin,

00:16:02.996 --> 00:16:05.699
and they could have a conversation
with someone in Russian.

00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:09.136
Just tap on the microphone and say,
"What are your store hours?"

00:16:09.703 --> 00:16:11.738
[Siri reads Spanish translation]

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:14.007
[Yael] You get back
the text and audio right away.

00:16:14.374 --> 00:16:18.111
And just turn the phone to landscape
to open conversation mode.

00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:20.147
We've designed a side-by-side view

00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:24.084
that's easy for two people to know
which side to follow in the conversation.

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:27.955
This mode is incredibly intuitive,
with just a single microphone button

00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:31.458
because the app intelligently detects
the language spoken

00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:34.194
and shows translation
on the correct side of the screen.

00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:39.166
Translate will make communicating
between languages easier than ever before,

00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:41.034
connecting people in new ways.

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:43.270
And we can't wait for you to try it.

00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:44.938
Thanks, Yael.

00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:47.074
Next up, Messages.

00:16:47.774 --> 00:16:51.712
Messages is how many of us communicate
with people most important to us.

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:54.248
And now we're using it more than ever.

00:16:54.314 --> 00:16:55.682
Compared to just a year ago,

00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:59.586
we have a record number of users
sending a record number of messages.

00:16:59.987 --> 00:17:02.222
And we've seen people use Messages
more and more

00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:04.958
to keep in touch
with their closest groups.

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:06.727
This year, we're introducing

00:17:06.793 --> 00:17:10.130
a new way to stay connected
with your most important conversations,

00:17:10.197 --> 00:17:13.267
giving you new ways
to express your identity with Memoji

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.237
and making big changes
to how we communicate in groups.

00:17:17.738 --> 00:17:20.340
To tell you more, here's Stacey Lysik.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:21.875
Thanks, Craig.

00:17:21.942 --> 00:17:25.045
First, let's get started
with Conversations.

00:17:25.112 --> 00:17:27.014
From the beginning, Messages was designed

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.750
to make it really easy
to get to your newest messages.

00:17:29.816 --> 00:17:31.818
But with so many active conversations,

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:35.289
sometimes it can be tough to get to
the ones that are most important to you.

00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:38.091
So we are introducing a new way

00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:41.795
to let you stay connected
to your most important conversations:

00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:44.331
by letting you pin them
at the top of your list

00:17:44.398 --> 00:17:45.899
so you can always get to them.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.871
And you can see messages as they come in
with a beautiful animation on the pin.

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:54.341
Next, let's talk about expressing yourself
with Memoji.

00:17:55.576 --> 00:17:59.580
There are over one trillion ways
to customize your identity with Memoji.

00:18:00.013 --> 00:18:03.417
In iOS 14, we're adding even more ways
to create your look

00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:06.320
with over 20 new hair and headwear styles

00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:10.023
to let you reflect your hobby, profession
and personality.

00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:14.528
We've also added something that's
even more relevant today: face coverings.

00:18:15.229 --> 00:18:17.898
And we're adding more age options too.

00:18:18.432 --> 00:18:22.135
My favorite way of using Memoji
is with Memoji stickers.

00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:24.838
And now we have
three brand-new Memoji stickers

00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:29.142
that let you send a hug, a fist bump
or even a blush to your friends.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.812
Last, let's chat about groups.

00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:35.182
When you're talking to a group,
sometimes there's so much going on,

00:18:35.249 --> 00:18:37.551
it can be hard to keep track
of the conversation.

00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:40.654
So this year, we're gonna help you
bring order to the chaos.

00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:43.190
First we're adding inline replies

00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:45.726
that let you reply
directly to a specific message.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.462
You can view replies
in the full conversation

00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:53.066
or you can view them as their own thread
so you can focus in on the specific topic.

00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:56.203
To make it even more clear
who a message was meant for,

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.671
we're introducing mentions.

00:18:58.238 --> 00:19:00.340
With mentions,
you can just type someone's name

00:19:00.407 --> 00:19:01.875
to direct a message to them.

00:19:02.543 --> 00:19:05.112
And now you have the ability
to only be notified

00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:07.414
when you're mentioned
in the group conversation.

00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:10.050
And check out
the top of this conversation.

00:19:10.117 --> 00:19:12.586
We have an all-new design
for how groups appear.

00:19:13.053 --> 00:19:14.855
It lets you see
all the members of your group,

00:19:14.922 --> 00:19:17.624
where the most recently active people
are shown largest.

00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:19.526
And, for the first time ever,

00:19:19.593 --> 00:19:23.230
you can create a unique visual identity
for your group

00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:24.698
by setting a group photo

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.634
or customizing your group's look
with an emoji.

00:19:28.535 --> 00:19:30.037
Inside the conversation

00:19:30.103 --> 00:19:32.639
you see group members' photos
around the image.

00:19:32.706 --> 00:19:34.842
Of course it looks great as a pin.

00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:37.511
You know who's most recently commented
in the group

00:19:37.578 --> 00:19:40.647
because their photo will appear
around the outside of the pin.

00:19:40.714 --> 00:19:43.750
And that's what's coming to Messages
in iOS 14:

00:19:43.817 --> 00:19:47.387
all-new pinned conversations,
fun updates to Memoji

00:19:47.454 --> 00:19:49.489
and powerful improvements to groups.

00:19:50.057 --> 00:19:51.291
Thanks, Stacey.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:55.195
Next, let's take a look at features
that help us while we're out and about.

00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:59.399
Now we know that life looks very different
for many of us right now,

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:01.168
but it won't always be this way.

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:01.168
but it won't always be this way.

00:20:01.235 --> 00:20:02.936
And as things start to open up,

00:20:03.003 --> 00:20:06.373
we have a new set of features
that will help us explore the world again,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.175
starting with Maps.

00:20:08.942 --> 00:20:11.845
Apple Maps is the best way to navigate
and explore the world,

00:20:11.912 --> 00:20:13.680
all while protecting your privacy.

00:20:13.747 --> 00:20:16.617
Over the past several years,
we've added many great features,

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:19.887
and of course we've been
rebuilding our map from the ground up.

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:23.323
Our new map finished rolling out
across the US earlier this year

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.593
and brought with it better navigation
and far richer detail

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.897
for roads, pedestrian paths,
landcover and more.

00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:33.734
The new map also offers
more accurate information for places

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.171
and allows us to build incredible features
like Look Around.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:40.474
Maps has come a long way,
and people have noticed.

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:42.509
Just look at this quote from Fast Company.

00:20:42.576 --> 00:20:45.546
"Apple Maps has improved
by leaps and bounds

00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:47.881
and is a formidable rival to Google Maps.

00:20:47.948 --> 00:20:50.184
It's also arguably got the better UI,

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.254
and by far-- by far--
the better privacy policy."

00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:56.056
We're excited to announce

00:20:56.123 --> 00:20:59.259
we're bringing our new map
to more countries later this year,

00:20:59.326 --> 00:21:02.396
including the UK, Ireland and Canada.

00:21:03.163 --> 00:21:06.033
In addition to the rich detail
and improved accuracy,

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:09.903
the new map serves as the foundation
for many great new features.

00:21:10.304 --> 00:21:12.472
In iOS 14, we're adding things

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:15.475
that will make it easier
for people to find places they love

00:21:15.542 --> 00:21:17.211
and help them get to where they're going

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.246
in ways that are better
for the environment.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.083
To tell you more,
I'll hand it off to Meg Frost.

00:21:23.684 --> 00:21:24.818
Thanks, Craig.

00:21:24.885 --> 00:21:28.121
First, let's talk about
finding great places.

00:21:28.188 --> 00:21:31.124
We have millions of people
coming to Maps every day

00:21:31.191 --> 00:21:33.193
to discover great new places,

00:21:33.594 --> 00:21:35.963
whether they're planning
their next big vacation

00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:38.165
or just looking for
something to eat nearby.

00:21:38.632 --> 00:21:40.067
In iOS 14,

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:44.104
the Maps team will be working with
some of the world's most trusted brands

00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:46.673
to offer amazing Guides.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.643
Guides for great places to eat, shop,

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.747
meet friends or explore
in cities around the world.

00:21:54.114 --> 00:21:57.518
You can save Guides
so you can easily get back to them later,

00:21:57.584 --> 00:22:01.255
and the best part is they automatically
update when new places are added,

00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:04.658
so you always have
the latest recommendations.

00:22:05.092 --> 00:22:07.861
In addition to helping you
discover great new places,

00:22:07.928 --> 00:22:11.698
Maps helps you get there
in a way that's better for the planet.

00:22:11.765 --> 00:22:14.368
For years,
Maps has made it easy to navigate

00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:18.105
using environmentally-friendly options
like public transit and walking.

00:22:18.572 --> 00:22:21.742
With iOS 14,
we're introducing great new features

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:24.344
to help our users
reduce their carbon footprint,

00:22:24.811 --> 00:22:28.215
and our first one is
also our most requested:

00:22:28.282 --> 00:22:29.616
It's Cycling.

00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:32.986
We've built an incredible
cycling experience

00:22:33.053 --> 00:22:35.355
that helps you get around town
on your bike.

00:22:36.123 --> 00:22:38.959
We're adding a dedicated cycling option
to Maps

00:22:39.026 --> 00:22:44.097
which allows users to ride their bike
along bike lanes, paths and roads.

00:22:44.498 --> 00:22:46.333
Maps takes elevation into account

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.336
to let you know if you're in for
a challenging uphill workout

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.638
or a leisurely flat ride.

00:22:52.005 --> 00:22:55.809
You can also see if your route
includes quiet or busy roads.

00:22:56.176 --> 00:22:59.279
We'll even let you know
if you have a steep passage coming up

00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:01.548
or if you'll need to carry your bike
up the stairs.

00:23:02.182 --> 00:23:05.452
You can also choose
to avoid stairs altogether.

00:23:06.353 --> 00:23:09.690
With iOS 14, we're bringing cycling
to New York City, LA,

00:23:09.756 --> 00:23:11.258
the San Francisco Bay Area,

00:23:11.325 --> 00:23:14.728
along with a number of cities in China
like Shanghai and Beijing.

00:23:15.195 --> 00:23:18.632
And we'll be adding many more cities
in the coming months.

00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:23.971
For environmentally conscious drivers,
we're also introducing EV routing.

00:23:25.005 --> 00:23:26.573
If you have an electric car,

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.244
Maps is going to help eliminate
range anxiety.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.981
With iOS 14,
Maps will track your current charge

00:23:34.047 --> 00:23:36.917
and factor in things
like elevation and weather

00:23:36.984 --> 00:23:40.621
to automatically add charging stops
along your route.

00:23:40.687 --> 00:23:44.124
And Maps will know
which type of charger works for your car,

00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:47.394
making sure to only route you
to compatible stations.

00:23:47.861 --> 00:23:49.897
We're working with a number
of manufacturers

00:23:49.963 --> 00:23:52.399
to support EV routing in their vehicles,

00:23:52.466 --> 00:23:54.368
including BMW and Ford,

00:23:54.434 --> 00:23:57.204
and we'll be adding many more
in the near future.

00:23:57.271 --> 00:24:02.776
Cities around the world are also working
to improve air quality and reduce traffic,

00:24:02.843 --> 00:24:06.213
so we're adding
congestion and green zones to Maps

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.617
to easily see where they are
along with alternate routing options.

00:24:11.185 --> 00:24:12.886
In addition, drivers in China

00:24:12.953 --> 00:24:16.356
can securely store their
license plate number on their iPhone,

00:24:16.423 --> 00:24:20.160
and Maps will let them know which days
they can enter congested city centers

00:24:20.227 --> 00:24:21.828
based on that number.

00:24:21.895 --> 00:24:24.631
And those are just some
of the great new features

00:24:24.698 --> 00:24:27.201
coming to Apple Maps in iOS 14,

00:24:27.267 --> 00:24:29.736
making Maps the best product

00:24:29.803 --> 00:24:32.840
to help users explore
and navigate their world.

00:24:33.874 --> 00:24:35.108
Thanks, Meg.

00:24:35.175 --> 00:24:37.611
And now, on to CarPlay,

00:24:37.678 --> 00:24:40.347
which has transformed
the driving experience for iPhone owners

00:24:40.414 --> 00:24:44.685
by being the smarter, safer way
to use the apps you love in your car.

00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:48.222
CarPlay is everywhere,
and it's incredibly popular.

00:24:48.288 --> 00:24:51.792
Here in the US,
it's available on basically every new car.

00:24:51.859 --> 00:24:55.896
And worldwide, it's available
on over 80% of new cars sold

00:24:55.963 --> 00:24:59.967
and has quickly become the default
in-car experience for so many people.

00:25:00.033 --> 00:25:04.338
People love CarPlay, and we get
some really passionate reactions.

00:25:04.404 --> 00:25:07.674
Joanna Stern says
it makes her life "infinitely better."

00:25:07.741 --> 00:25:11.245
We have some great updates for iOS 14.

00:25:11.311 --> 00:25:15.816
First up, we have new wallpaper options
perfect for the car.

00:25:15.883 --> 00:25:18.619
And we're adding support
for new categories of CarPlay apps:

00:25:18.685 --> 00:25:22.422
parking, EV charging
and quick food ordering.

00:25:22.489 --> 00:25:25.425
In addition to this,
we're really excited for the next step

00:25:25.492 --> 00:25:28.128
in how we're transforming
your relationship with your car

00:25:28.195 --> 00:25:30.364
by rethinking car keys.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.132
They've been around
for over a hundred years,

00:25:32.199 --> 00:25:36.403
but they've become big, bulky
and ripe for reimagining.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.705
To tell you more about
what we have planned,

00:25:38.772 --> 00:25:41.275
let's go to the garage
with Emily Schubert.

00:25:42.709 --> 00:25:43.777
Thanks, Craig.

00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:46.914
I'm excited to introduce
a digital version of car keys.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.316
Now you can leave your keys at home

00:25:49.383 --> 00:25:51.852
and unlock and start your car
with your iPhone.

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:57.124
And the very first car to support this
will be the new 2021 BMW 5 Series.

00:25:57.191 --> 00:25:58.559
Let me show you how it works.

00:25:58.625 --> 00:26:00.060
It's super simple.

00:26:00.127 --> 00:26:02.596
-It uses NFC, and you just tap to unlock.
-[beeps]

00:26:04.298 --> 00:26:07.835
And I place my phone on the charging pad
and then push to start.

00:26:07.901 --> 00:26:08.869
[chimes]

00:26:08.936 --> 00:26:12.539
But this goes beyond just one less thing
you have to keep in your pocket.

00:26:12.973 --> 00:26:15.242
Digital keys have security benefits.

00:26:15.309 --> 00:26:18.178
They live in the Secure Element
of your iPhone,

00:26:18.245 --> 00:26:22.716
and if it goes missing, you can turn off
your keys remotely via iCloud.

00:26:23.317 --> 00:26:25.786
They're even easier to share
than a physical key.

00:26:25.853 --> 00:26:28.655
Copies don't involve
trips to the dealership.

00:26:28.722 --> 00:26:32.025
And you can share
from wherever you are with iMessage.

00:26:32.793 --> 00:26:36.096
Let's give Craig a key so he can
drive home after we're done here.

00:26:37.064 --> 00:26:39.800
With each key you share,
you can set options,

00:26:39.867 --> 00:26:44.004
like a restricted driving profile,
perfect for teen drivers.

00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:46.306
Which is tempting,

00:26:46.373 --> 00:26:48.876
but we'll give Craig full access.

00:26:50.777 --> 00:26:51.778
[phone chimes]

00:26:53.981 --> 00:26:56.717
-[phone chimes]
-Full access? Thanks, Emily.

00:26:57.251 --> 00:27:00.754
The new BMW will be available
to customers next month.

00:27:00.821 --> 00:27:03.257
In addition to adding this feature
to iOS 14,

00:27:03.323 --> 00:27:05.492
we're also enabling it in iOS 13,

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:08.595
so customers can use their car keys
even sooner.

00:27:09.129 --> 00:27:11.999
Of course,
we want this to work in any car,

00:27:12.065 --> 00:27:14.768
so we've been working on standards
with industry groups.

00:27:14.835 --> 00:27:16.670
And this is just the beginning.

00:27:16.737 --> 00:27:19.806
We're working on technology
that will leverage our U1 chip,

00:27:19.873 --> 00:27:24.578
which uses Ultra Wideband technology
for precise spatial awareness.

00:27:24.645 --> 00:27:27.314
So you'll be able to leave your iPhone
in your bag or pocket

00:27:27.381 --> 00:27:30.551
and still securely
unlock and start your car.

00:27:30.617 --> 00:27:34.788
We expect to see support for this standard
starting in new cars next year.

00:27:35.355 --> 00:27:38.225
Now, let's turn to the App Store.

00:27:38.292 --> 00:27:39.426
Twelve years ago,

00:27:39.493 --> 00:27:42.863
we revolutionized the industry
with the launch of the App Store.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.868
Today we have so many amazing apps
that offer a rich set of experiences,

00:27:47.935 --> 00:27:51.071
we can truly say
that for everything we want to do,

00:27:51.138 --> 00:27:53.273
"There's an app for that."

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.577
So now it's time for us to extend
the success of the App Store

00:27:56.643 --> 00:27:59.680
and make apps available and accessible
in whole new ways.

00:28:00.214 --> 00:28:03.917
What if you could have the right app
you needed at just the right moment?

00:28:03.984 --> 00:28:06.653
Let's look at what it would be like
if you did.

00:28:07.554 --> 00:28:09.623
[narrator]
Today, no matter what you want to do,

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.924
there's an app for that.

00:28:10.991 --> 00:28:13.961
<i>But what if you don't have the app
you need right when you need it?</i>

00:28:14.027 --> 00:28:18.432
<i>Like when you need to pay for parking.
Well, now there's an App Clip for that.</i>

00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:20.167
[car chirps]

00:28:20.667 --> 00:28:23.270
Ooh. Look, a new coffee shop.

00:28:23.337 --> 00:28:24.938
There's an App Clip for that.

00:28:27.341 --> 00:28:29.910
<i>Or a friend sends you a message
with a print you like.</i>

00:28:30.711 --> 00:28:32.246
There's an App Clip for that.

00:28:32.713 --> 00:28:34.248
That looks nice.

00:28:34.314 --> 00:28:37.184
<i>Looking for somewhere to eat nearby?
App Clip.</i>

00:28:37.818 --> 00:28:39.553
Very health conscious of you.

00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:43.557
<i>Hey, there's a scooter.
Let's take it for a spin.</i>

00:28:43.624 --> 00:28:44.791
Yep. App Clip.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.264
<i>Mmm. Ice cream. Wait.
There isn't one for that yet?</i>

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.100
<i>Well, soon there could be
an App Clip for that.</i>

00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:54.067
And that.

00:28:54.134 --> 00:28:55.035
And that.

00:28:55.102 --> 00:28:56.003
And that.

00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:57.337
-And that.
-[martial artist] Hi-yah!

00:29:00.941 --> 00:29:03.744
An App Clip is a small part of an app.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.346
It's light and fast and easy to discover,

00:29:06.413 --> 00:29:09.016
so you can quickly get what you need
right when you need it.

00:29:09.917 --> 00:29:13.253
Everything about App Clips
is designed for speed.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.223
They start with this card
which quickly pops up.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.326
And with just a tap,
you can launch the App Clip.

00:29:19.393 --> 00:29:21.428
You don't need to enter
credit card numbers

00:29:21.495 --> 00:29:24.364
because App Clips
can use Apple Pay for payments.

00:29:24.431 --> 00:29:27.100
And you don't have to manually
log into an account

00:29:27.167 --> 00:29:29.837
because it can take advantage
of Sign in with Apple.

00:29:30.504 --> 00:29:32.873
App Clips won't clutter your Home Screen

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.609
and will only stay along
as long as you need them.

00:29:35.676 --> 00:29:40.514
But you can easily launch recently used
App Clips from the new App Library.

00:29:40.581 --> 00:29:42.850
It's always easy to download the full app,

00:29:42.916 --> 00:29:45.752
and this makes App Clips
an easy way to discover

00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:48.555
more of what the App Store has to offer.

00:29:48.622 --> 00:29:50.557
And discovery is key.

00:29:50.624 --> 00:29:54.461
App Clips are all about getting to a part
of an app at the moment you need it,

00:29:54.528 --> 00:29:57.497
so it was critical that we made them
really easy to find.

00:29:58.131 --> 00:30:01.335
App Clips can be easily discovered
and launched from the web.

00:29:58.131 --> 00:30:01.335
App Clips can be easily discovered
and launched from the web.

00:30:01.401 --> 00:30:04.438
You can launch App Clips from Messages
when friends share them with you.

00:30:04.505 --> 00:30:07.074
When you want to order takeout
from a restaurant in Maps,

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.110
you can launch an App Clip
right from a place card.

00:30:10.177 --> 00:30:14.515
You'll be able to tap on NFC tags out in
the world, on things like parking meters.

00:30:14.581 --> 00:30:16.316
Or you can scan QR codes

00:30:16.383 --> 00:30:19.219
to launch App Clips
that work with products you purchase.

00:30:19.286 --> 00:30:24.191
The best way to discover App Clips will be
with the new Apple-designed App Clip code.

00:30:24.258 --> 00:30:28.295
So when you see one, you'll know
that there's an App Clip waiting for you.

00:30:28.362 --> 00:30:31.431
They incorporate
both a visual code and NFC,

00:30:31.498 --> 00:30:36.103
so you tap on them or scan them with
the camera to bring up an App Clip.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.806
App Clips will be great for businesses
that already have apps.

00:30:39.873 --> 00:30:42.543
But we want to be able
to use App Clips everywhere,

00:30:42.609 --> 00:30:46.380
including smaller spots
that may not have their own app.

00:30:46.446 --> 00:30:50.284
So we made it possible for apps like Yelp,
which support multiple businesses,

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:54.688
to create App Clip experiences
for each of the places they work with.

00:30:54.755 --> 00:30:57.558
Developers will create App Clips
from a part of an app,

00:30:57.624 --> 00:31:00.627
using Xcode and the full power of the SDK.

00:31:01.028 --> 00:31:02.429
To ensure that they launch quickly,

00:31:02.496 --> 00:31:05.632
they'll need to be
less than 10 megabytes in size.

00:31:05.699 --> 00:31:07.901
And that's App Clips.

00:31:07.968 --> 00:31:09.670
Immediately discoverable,

00:31:09.736 --> 00:31:11.872
small in size, so they launch fast,

00:31:11.939 --> 00:31:14.274
integrated Apple Pay for easy payment,

00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:17.644
Sign in with Apple
for quick and privacy-friendly login

00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:20.447
and the option to download the full app
from the App Store

00:31:20.514 --> 00:31:22.049
when you want to keep it around.

00:31:22.115 --> 00:31:25.886
We can't wait to see all the App Clips
developers will create.

00:31:25.953 --> 00:31:28.388
And that's iOS 14.

00:31:28.455 --> 00:31:32.526
It's a huge release that transforms
the core experience of iPhone,

00:31:32.593 --> 00:31:35.195
with redesigned widgets
right on the Home Screen

00:31:35.262 --> 00:31:38.398
and a new way to organize your apps
with the App Library.

00:31:38.899 --> 00:31:41.568
It adds incredible updates
to some of the most popular apps,

00:31:41.635 --> 00:31:44.037
with powerful improvements
to Messages and Maps,

00:31:44.104 --> 00:31:47.140
and introduces a whole new way
to tap into apps

00:31:47.207 --> 00:31:48.542
with App Clips.

00:31:48.609 --> 00:31:50.844
And next up, iPadOS.

00:31:50.911 --> 00:31:53.480
["S.S. Luker's Mom" by Oh Sees playing]

00:32:01.255 --> 00:32:02.990
Oh, hey, we made it.

00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:04.925
All right. Well, let's jump right in.

00:32:05.392 --> 00:32:09.696
iPadOS builds on
all the amazing features of iOS

00:32:09.763 --> 00:32:12.032
while adding unique capabilities

00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:15.602
that deliver a distinct experience
for iPad.

00:32:16.436 --> 00:32:20.974
Like using Apple Pencil for taking notes,
markup and illustration.

00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:22.643
A reimagined track pad experience

00:32:22.709 --> 00:32:25.512
that lets you interact with iPad
in a whole new way.

00:32:25.579 --> 00:32:28.182
And unmatched AR experiences with ARKit

00:32:28.248 --> 00:32:31.552
and the amazing new LiDAR Scanner
in iPad Pro.

00:32:31.618 --> 00:32:35.189
All of this combines to put iPad
into a class of its own.

00:32:36.323 --> 00:32:38.892
iPad excels at "every type of input"

00:32:38.959 --> 00:32:42.129
and is a "product to do anything
and everything."

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:48.235
Which brings us to this year
and our new release, iPadOS 14.

00:32:49.102 --> 00:32:51.104
Let's start with experience.

00:32:51.438 --> 00:32:55.342
This year iPadOS delivers
unique made-for-iPad designs

00:32:55.409 --> 00:32:59.546
that take great advantage
of the iPad's large, multi-touch display.

00:32:59.613 --> 00:33:02.115
Now iPad has always been about the apps.

00:33:02.182 --> 00:33:05.919
In the beginning, we focused on
giving the ecosystem of iPhone apps

00:33:05.986 --> 00:33:09.723
a larger canvas
to deliver new and unique experiences.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.993
This quickly sparked
an entirely new set of apps,

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.595
designed for iPad first,

00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:16.296
with immersive experiences

00:33:16.363 --> 00:33:18.665
that transform this magical sheet of glass

00:33:18.732 --> 00:33:20.334
into whatever you needed it to be.

00:33:20.834 --> 00:33:24.137
We're proud of the over one million apps
on the App Store today

00:33:24.204 --> 00:33:26.874
designed just for iPad.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.544
With customers continuing to push
their iPads further than ever before,

00:33:30.611 --> 00:33:32.746
we're extending
the design language of iPad

00:33:32.813 --> 00:33:36.416
to make apps more streamlined
and more powerful.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.286
To give you a live look
at these enhancements,

00:33:39.353 --> 00:33:41.722
I'll hand it over to Josh Shaffer.

00:33:42.055 --> 00:33:43.090
Thanks, Craig.

00:33:43.524 --> 00:33:45.826
Let's take a look at
some of the enhancements to iPadOS.

00:33:45.893 --> 00:33:47.594
The first thing that you'll notice

00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:50.898
are the same redesigned widgets
that you saw in iOS 14.

00:33:51.298 --> 00:33:53.333
They look great on iPad as well,

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.603
and they give you information at a glance
whenever you go Home.

00:33:57.171 --> 00:34:00.474
But let's see some of the improvements
in the apps, starting with Photos.

00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:03.810
iPad is the perfect device
for browsing your photos.

00:34:04.211 --> 00:34:07.814
Its large canvas lets you immerse yourself
in all your favorite memories.

00:34:07.881 --> 00:34:11.919
And this year, we're making it even easier
to browse and organize your photos

00:34:11.985 --> 00:34:13.387
with an all-new sidebar.

00:34:13.954 --> 00:34:17.024
With just a tap of this button,
I can reveal the sidebar,

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:20.394
with all the core functionality of the app
in a single location.

00:34:21.128 --> 00:34:23.397
My photos remain front and center,

00:34:23.463 --> 00:34:26.567
but now I can quickly tap to move
between parts of the app.

00:34:26.967 --> 00:34:30.704
The sidebar is a really powerful way
to organize your photos too.

00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:33.240
I can easily drag a photo to the sidebar

00:34:33.607 --> 00:34:36.009
and then just drop it
to add it to an album.

00:34:36.076 --> 00:34:39.346
We've brought this sidebar to many apps
across iPadOS.

00:34:39.746 --> 00:34:40.747
Like Notes,

00:34:40.814 --> 00:34:44.051
where it provides quick and easy access
to all your folders.

00:34:44.618 --> 00:34:48.789
And Files, where we've consolidated
navigation into the sidebar

00:34:48.856 --> 00:34:50.757
for a streamlined new design.

00:34:50.824 --> 00:34:52.893
We've also streamlined the toolbars,

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.863
adding new drop-down menus
that consolidate functions

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:57.798
into a single, easy-to-access button.

00:34:58.465 --> 00:35:01.068
I can just tap to change views like this.

00:35:01.134 --> 00:35:02.836
And for even quicker access,

00:35:02.903 --> 00:35:06.974
I can just tap and drag to change
the sort order, all in a single motion.

00:35:07.674 --> 00:35:11.078
You'll find this same approach
across other apps, like Calendar,

00:35:11.411 --> 00:35:14.314
where we've brought controls
into a single toolbar at the top,

00:35:14.748 --> 00:35:16.683
providing more space for your content

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:20.754
and a single unified place to access
all the app's functionality.

00:35:20.821 --> 00:35:23.323
Finally, Music has been updated

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.360
to take even better advantage
of iPad's large screen.

00:35:26.827 --> 00:35:29.696
The sidebar in Music makes it easy
to move between views.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:34.067
I can quickly jump between
the new Listen Now and my playlists.

00:35:34.401 --> 00:35:36.270
-And once I start playing a song...
-["Caution" by The Killers playing]

00:35:36.336 --> 00:35:39.006
...I can bring up the brand-new
full-screen player,

00:35:39.072 --> 00:35:42.509
where I can see rich album art,
transport controls and lyrics,

00:35:42.576 --> 00:35:44.378
-all in one single view.
-[song fades]

00:35:44.444 --> 00:35:46.180
And these are just
some of the enhancements

00:35:46.246 --> 00:35:48.415
that are coming to apps in iPadOS.

00:35:49.049 --> 00:35:51.318
We're really loving these new app designs.

00:35:51.385 --> 00:35:52.553
But there's more,

00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:54.254
starting with Siri.

00:35:54.688 --> 00:35:57.691
The new compact Siri design
that you heard about in iOS 14

00:35:57.758 --> 00:36:00.093
is especially useful on iPad.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.196
Results appear at the bottom right corner,

00:36:02.262 --> 00:36:05.632
allowing you to easily reference the app
while using Siri.

00:36:05.699 --> 00:36:08.802
And we applied this same approach
to other parts of the experience...

00:36:10.637 --> 00:36:11.638
like calls.

00:36:11.705 --> 00:36:15.008
Now today when you receive a call
on iPad, you see this.

00:36:15.075 --> 00:36:16.076
[beeps]

00:36:16.143 --> 00:36:18.645
Whatever you were working on
is suddenly completely covered

00:36:18.712 --> 00:36:20.547
with the incoming call screen.

00:36:20.614 --> 00:36:21.748
Not cool.

00:36:21.815 --> 00:36:24.051
Wouldn't it be nicer
if instead you saw this?

00:36:24.117 --> 00:36:25.285
[beeps]

00:36:25.352 --> 00:36:26.553
Well, that's much better.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.023
Now an incoming call is presented
with a compact notification

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.292
that doesn't take you out of context.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.430
And you can simply tap to answer
or flick it away to dismiss.

00:36:36.997 --> 00:36:39.900
And this applies to all calls,
including those from your iPhone

00:36:39.967 --> 00:36:42.035
or third-party VoIP apps like Skype.

00:36:42.102 --> 00:36:43.170
[rings]

00:36:43.237 --> 00:36:46.473
And of course we're bringing this
to iOS as well.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.309
We think our iPhone customers
are going to love it.

00:36:49.376 --> 00:36:53.046
Now there's one more key experience
we've redesigned for iPad this year,

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.315
and that's Search.

00:36:55.382 --> 00:36:57.985
Today Search is a full-screen experience,

00:36:58.051 --> 00:37:00.854
and sometimes you can lose track
of your context.

00:37:00.921 --> 00:37:04.057
So we've redesigned Search
with a new, compact design.

00:37:04.124 --> 00:37:07.127
You can start a search from anywhere,
like the Home Screen

00:37:07.194 --> 00:37:08.962
or over any app.

00:37:09.029 --> 00:37:10.964
And this makes it easy
to find what you need

00:37:11.031 --> 00:37:13.634
without feeling like you've left the app
you're working in.

00:37:14.034 --> 00:37:15.736
But we didn't just redesign it.

00:37:15.802 --> 00:37:20.440
We've rebuilt Search from the ground up
to be Universal,

00:37:20.507 --> 00:37:24.311
becoming a single destination
where you can start all of your searches.

00:37:24.645 --> 00:37:27.181
First, we made it better than ever
as an app launcher.

00:37:27.247 --> 00:37:29.216
You just start typing a few characters,

00:37:29.283 --> 00:37:31.852
and you can instantly get
to where you're going.

00:37:31.919 --> 00:37:35.622
It's also great for finding contacts
to message or call

00:37:35.689 --> 00:37:36.890
or documents.

00:37:36.957 --> 00:37:42.095
You can even search directly into apps
like Keynote, Messages, Mail or Files.

00:37:42.162 --> 00:37:44.498
Or look up information
about people or places.

00:37:44.965 --> 00:37:48.969
And it's also a great place to start
all of your web searches as well.

00:37:49.036 --> 00:37:50.304
As soon as you start typing,

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.840
you get relevant suggestions
to complete your search.

00:37:52.906 --> 00:37:56.176
And you can get to your web search results
with just a tap.

00:37:56.243 --> 00:37:59.213
And Search now makes navigating
to your favorite websites

00:37:59.279 --> 00:38:01.849
just as easy as launching an app.

00:38:01.915 --> 00:38:05.686
Just type a few letters and the top hit
will take you right to Safari.

00:38:07.087 --> 00:38:10.457
So those are some of our updates
to the iPad experience.

00:38:10.524 --> 00:38:12.292
And of course,
you also get the new widgets

00:38:12.359 --> 00:38:15.729
and all the other great app enhancements
from iOS 14.

00:38:16.864 --> 00:38:21.101
Next, we want to push forward your ability
to express yourself creatively

00:38:21.168 --> 00:38:23.737
with improvements to Apple Pencil.

00:38:24.938 --> 00:38:27.074
Apple Pencil is a game-changing tool

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.910
that turns iPad into
a professional drawing canvas,

00:38:29.977 --> 00:38:32.613
a great way to mark up and sign documents

00:38:32.679 --> 00:38:35.249
and the ultimate note-taking device.

00:38:35.315 --> 00:38:38.852
What many people love most
about taking notes with Apple Pencil

00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:41.889
is how they can express themselves
in a free-form way.

00:38:41.955 --> 00:38:45.559
Mixing handwriting and drawings can be
the best way to capture your thoughts.

00:38:45.626 --> 00:38:48.929
Now the challenge is
when you want to change things afterwards.

00:38:48.996 --> 00:38:53.066
Here, working with handwriting
just isn't as easy as with typed text.

00:38:53.133 --> 00:38:55.269
Now, we sometimes take it for granted,

00:38:55.335 --> 00:38:57.971
but with typed text
it's so easy to select,

00:38:58.038 --> 00:39:00.007
copy and paste into another document,

00:39:00.073 --> 00:39:02.843
or even just make space for more text.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:06.747
Well, this year, we're going to make
handwriting just as easy

00:39:06.813 --> 00:39:08.348
and just as powerful.

00:39:08.415 --> 00:39:09.750
But that's not all.

00:39:09.816 --> 00:39:13.320
Our customers tell us that once they have
an Apple Pencil in their hand,

00:39:13.387 --> 00:39:14.821
they don't want to put it away.

00:39:14.888 --> 00:39:18.725
So this year,
we're bringing Scribble to iPad.

00:39:19.226 --> 00:39:21.295
So you can handwrite into any text field,

00:39:21.361 --> 00:39:23.864
and it will automatically
be converted to text.

00:39:24.464 --> 00:39:26.300
To show you all of this in action,

00:39:26.366 --> 00:39:29.369
I'd like to welcome Jenny Chen
for a live demo.

00:39:29.636 --> 00:39:30.604
Thanks, Craig.

00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:33.774
I'm really excited to show you
some great new features we have

00:39:33.841 --> 00:39:36.210
for Apple Pencil and iPadOS this year.

00:39:36.276 --> 00:39:39.146
One of the great parts about taking notes
with the Apple Pencil

00:39:39.213 --> 00:39:41.348
is that it really lets you work
in a free-form way.

00:39:41.415 --> 00:39:43.283
I can just start writing anywhere.

00:39:43.717 --> 00:39:45.853
And it's not just about text.

00:39:45.919 --> 00:39:49.857
I can also express myself
with drawings or shapes.

00:39:49.923 --> 00:39:53.026
But sometimes you want that
more professional, cleaned-up look.

00:39:53.093 --> 00:39:56.463
So now, when I draw a simple shape
and pause at the end,

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:59.399
it'll automatically convert
to that ideal shape.

00:39:59.933 --> 00:40:02.769
And we're smart about it,
retaining the same size

00:39:59.933 --> 00:40:02.769
And we're smart about it,
retaining the same size

00:40:03.537 --> 00:40:05.138
and angle that you drew it at.

00:40:06.573 --> 00:40:07.808
In addition to shapes,

00:40:07.875 --> 00:40:10.777
we've also made huge improvements
to our handwriting recognition.

00:40:10.844 --> 00:40:13.747
So now, when I write,
I can easily make a selection

00:40:13.814 --> 00:40:16.350
using the same gestures
that I use for typed text.

00:40:16.416 --> 00:40:20.420
I can double tap to select a word
or double tap again to select a line.

00:40:21.288 --> 00:40:24.024
Thanks to our advanced,
on-device machine learning,

00:40:24.091 --> 00:40:26.159
you'll notice how we can
select the handwriting

00:40:26.226 --> 00:40:28.562
while avoiding the drawings nearby.

00:40:28.629 --> 00:40:29.930
Now that I have the selection,

00:40:29.997 --> 00:40:33.433
I can easily change the color
or move it around the document.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.437
It's also perfectly easy for me
to make space for more room to write.

00:40:37.771 --> 00:40:41.141
We think that this will make note-taking
with the Apple Pencil even better.

00:40:41.208 --> 00:40:45.145
Now, you don't even have to put it down
when you want to do something else.

00:40:45.212 --> 00:40:48.081
Let's say you want to search
for "Edison bulbs" in Safari.

00:40:48.515 --> 00:40:51.552
Using Scribble, I can just write
directly into the text field...

00:40:54.087 --> 00:40:56.757
and it automatically
gets converted to typed text.

00:40:56.823 --> 00:40:59.359
It also works in any text field,

00:40:59.426 --> 00:41:01.061
so I can easily add a new Reminder

00:41:01.128 --> 00:41:03.297
to my shared Reminders list
with my husband.

00:41:05.933 --> 00:41:07.367
I've also been learning Chinese,

00:41:07.434 --> 00:41:10.304
so I want to surprise him
with some of my progress and skills.

00:41:10.771 --> 00:41:12.773
I'll use Scratch to delete "lights."

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:17.010
And then I can use Scribble to write "new"
and then "light fixture" in Chinese.

00:41:18.212 --> 00:41:23.217
You'll notice how Scribble recognizes
both English and Chinese in the same line.

00:41:23.817 --> 00:41:26.186
And what's awesome is that
we can build on this technology

00:41:26.253 --> 00:41:29.156
to deliver other great features,
like Data Detectors.

00:41:29.223 --> 00:41:31.425
We can automatically detect
what you write,

00:41:31.491 --> 00:41:33.760
like phone numbers,
so I can make a phone call.

00:41:34.228 --> 00:41:36.797
Or addresses, so I can look up directions.

00:41:37.564 --> 00:41:41.168
We can use these features together
to do even more with your handwriting.

00:41:41.568 --> 00:41:44.438
Let's say I wanted to use my handwriting
in another app.

00:41:44.505 --> 00:41:46.173
I can easily select what I want,

00:41:46.807 --> 00:41:49.109
tap the new Copy as Text
from the callout bar,

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.246
and then paste it into an app like Pages.

00:41:52.312 --> 00:41:54.915
And it's automatically converted
to typed text.

00:41:54.982 --> 00:41:57.951
We're really excited
about these awesome new features.

00:41:58.018 --> 00:42:00.821
And we think it will let you do
even more with the Apple Pencil.

00:42:01.555 --> 00:42:02.556
Thanks, Jenny.

00:42:02.623 --> 00:42:04.591
So those are the enhancements to Pencil.

00:42:04.658 --> 00:42:07.394
Just one part of an amazing release,

00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:10.197
with Scribble for handwriting
into any text field,

00:42:10.264 --> 00:42:12.900
a whole new way to work
with your handwritten notes,

00:42:12.966 --> 00:42:15.736
broad enhancements to the app experience,

00:42:15.802 --> 00:42:18.438
and of course, iPad users also benefit

00:42:18.505 --> 00:42:21.808
from the great features
you already saw in iOS 14

00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:24.178
and much more that
we didn't have time to talk about.

00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:27.314
So that's iOS and iPadOS.

00:42:27.381 --> 00:42:29.883
Next, let's talk about AirPods.

00:42:30.417 --> 00:42:31.752
From the one-click setup

00:42:31.818 --> 00:42:34.021
to the automatic pairing
with all your devices

00:42:34.087 --> 00:42:36.223
to how they pause your audio
when you take them out,

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.660
people love the magical experience
that AirPods deliver.

00:42:40.294 --> 00:42:43.430
Now we're bringing even more magic
to AirPods.

00:42:43.497 --> 00:42:47.134
To tell you all about it,
here's Mary-Ann Ionascu.

00:42:47.534 --> 00:42:48.602
Thanks, Craig.

00:42:48.669 --> 00:42:52.172
We have some amazing updates
coming to AirPods,

00:42:52.239 --> 00:42:53.907
starting with Automatic Switching.

00:42:54.408 --> 00:42:57.244
AirPods will now seamlessly move
between your devices

00:42:57.311 --> 00:43:00.047
without you having
to manually switch them.

00:43:00.113 --> 00:43:02.516
Let's say you just finished
listening to a podcast

00:43:02.583 --> 00:43:05.185
and you pick up your iPad to watch a show.

00:43:05.252 --> 00:43:07.788
AirPods will magically switch over.

00:43:07.855 --> 00:43:10.457
And later you start a video conference
on your Mac.

00:43:10.524 --> 00:43:13.527
AirPods will automatically switch again.

00:43:13.594 --> 00:43:15.195
-[ringing]
-And if a phone call comes in,

00:43:15.262 --> 00:43:18.732
the audio in your AirPods
will route right back to your phone.

00:43:18.799 --> 00:43:22.603
We also have an exciting new feature
coming to AirPods Pro:

00:43:22.669 --> 00:43:24.771
spatial audio.

00:43:24.838 --> 00:43:27.474
You know the experience
of being in a movie theater

00:43:27.541 --> 00:43:30.644
with a state-of-the-art
surround sound system,

00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:33.514
one where the sound
not only comes from in front of you...

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.682
-[tone pulsing]
-...but also from the left, the right,

00:43:35.749 --> 00:43:37.985
behind, and even from above you?

00:43:38.051 --> 00:43:43.457
Well, we are thrilled to bring that same
immersive experience to AirPods Pro.

00:43:43.524 --> 00:43:45.526
But it turns out it's a lot harder to do

00:43:45.592 --> 00:43:48.495
when you only have a single earbud
in each ear.

00:43:48.562 --> 00:43:52.699
So our team created advanced
spatial audio algorithms for AirPods Pro

00:43:52.766 --> 00:43:55.903
that replicate
the movie theater experience.

00:43:55.969 --> 00:43:58.172
By applying directional audio filters

00:43:58.238 --> 00:44:01.675
and subtly adjusting the frequencies
each ear receives,

00:44:01.742 --> 00:44:03.911
we can place sounds
virtually anywhere in space...

00:44:03.977 --> 00:44:05.145
[high-speed vehicles passing]

00:44:05.212 --> 00:44:08.048
...creating an immersive
surround sound experience.

00:44:08.515 --> 00:44:13.253
But to truly deliver on this promise,
we had to factor in real-life situations.

00:44:13.954 --> 00:44:16.323
First, people move their heads.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:18.859
For an authentic
surround sound experience,

00:44:18.926 --> 00:44:21.028
you need the sound field to stay fixed

00:44:21.094 --> 00:44:23.530
so the voice feels like
it's coming from the actor

00:44:23.597 --> 00:44:25.899
and not some random point in space.

00:44:25.966 --> 00:44:29.336
So we use the accelerometer
and gyroscopes in AirPods Pro

00:44:29.403 --> 00:44:31.038
to track the motion of your head,

00:44:31.572 --> 00:44:35.008
remapping the sound field
so it stays anchored to your device,

00:44:35.075 --> 00:44:37.244
even as your head moves.

00:44:37.311 --> 00:44:39.346
And it's not only your head that can move,

00:44:39.413 --> 00:44:42.449
but you might move
your iPad or iPhone as well.

00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:44.918
That's why we constantly compare
the motion data

00:44:44.985 --> 00:44:47.221
from your head and your screen

00:44:47.287 --> 00:44:50.724
to understand how they are moving
in relation to each other.

00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:53.961
So if your bus turns the corner
or your plane banks,

00:44:54.027 --> 00:44:56.196
the sound stays in sync.

00:44:56.263 --> 00:44:58.765
The result is a surround sound experience

00:44:58.832 --> 00:45:01.401
that keeps you
in the middle of the action,

00:45:01.468 --> 00:45:02.736
no matter where you go.

00:45:03.203 --> 00:45:08.242
Spatial audio for AirPods Pro will work
with content encoded in 5.1, 7.1,

00:45:08.308 --> 00:45:09.843
and even Dolby Atmos.

00:45:10.377 --> 00:45:11.545
Thanks, Mary-Ann.

00:45:11.612 --> 00:45:13.680
I've been using the new spatial audio,

00:45:13.747 --> 00:45:16.049
and I think you're all
really gonna love it.

00:45:16.116 --> 00:45:19.086
All right. Next let's head
to the Fitness Center

00:45:19.152 --> 00:45:21.889
to hear the latest on watchOS from Kevin.

00:45:21.955 --> 00:45:24.491
["I'm Getting Tired"
by Jacknife Lee playing]

00:45:35.602 --> 00:45:36.837
[song ends]

00:45:36.904 --> 00:45:40.040
Thanks, Craig.
Since we launched Apple Watch,

00:45:40.107 --> 00:45:42.376
it's completely redefined
what a watch can do,

00:45:42.442 --> 00:45:44.311
and this has been
incredibly meaningful work.

00:45:44.711 --> 00:45:47.481
Apple Watch not only helps you
stay connected and active,

00:45:47.548 --> 00:45:49.783
it's become an intelligent guardian
of your health,

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:54.521
enabling you to take an ECG, detect falls
and call emergency services for you.

00:45:54.988 --> 00:45:58.091
It's impacting lives in ways
that were inconceivable five years ago.

00:45:58.792 --> 00:46:01.695
The power of Apple Watch
is not only its built-in features,

00:46:01.762 --> 00:46:03.997
but how developers
have personalized it for you.

00:46:04.498 --> 00:46:06.900
We introduced the App Store in watchOS 6,

00:46:06.967 --> 00:46:10.170
and there are now over 20,000
watchOS apps available.

00:46:10.237 --> 00:46:12.539
These apps bring the information
you care about most

00:46:12.606 --> 00:46:14.374
to just a glance at your watch face.

00:46:14.441 --> 00:46:17.077
We're taking this even further
in watchOS 7,

00:46:17.144 --> 00:46:19.012
starting with complications.

00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:23.350
Until today, an app could appear in only
one spot at a time on a watch face.

00:46:23.417 --> 00:46:27.187
In watchOS 7 developers can
enable multiple complications,

00:46:27.254 --> 00:46:29.690
making even more richly personal
watch faces.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.492
So if you like to use
Dawn Patrol for surfing,

00:46:32.559 --> 00:46:34.161
you can create your own surf watch,

00:46:34.228 --> 00:46:37.531
including water temperature,
swell and wind speed predictions

00:46:37.598 --> 00:46:38.966
for your favorite beach.

00:46:39.032 --> 00:46:41.034
Or new parents can use Glow Baby

00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:44.738
to see nap, changing and feeding times
all on one face.

00:46:44.805 --> 00:46:48.308
While Nike Run Club can display stats
like pace from your last run

00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:49.910
and your weekly run goals.

00:46:50.511 --> 00:46:53.447
We're also bringing rich complications
to more faces,

00:46:53.514 --> 00:46:55.883
including a fresh Chronograph face

00:46:55.949 --> 00:46:57.784
with an integrated tachymeter

00:46:57.851 --> 00:46:59.553
and an updated Extra Large face

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.523
with a huge, rich complication
right in the center.

00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:05.192
And Configuring Watch Faces
has been redesigned

00:47:05.259 --> 00:47:08.962
so you can easily select
which information you'd like to see.

00:47:09.396 --> 00:47:11.265
As developers, with watchOS 7

00:47:11.331 --> 00:47:14.601
you can now build your rich complications
with native SwiftUI.

00:47:15.169 --> 00:47:17.404
While there are so many ways
to configure watch faces,

00:47:17.471 --> 00:47:19.940
you may not have yet gone in
and set these up for yourself yet.

00:47:20.007 --> 00:47:21.008
That's okay.

00:47:21.074 --> 00:47:24.945
With watchOS 7 we're making it super easy
to share watch faces,

00:47:25.012 --> 00:47:27.814
so you can discover a face
that works perfectly for you.

00:47:27.881 --> 00:47:30.684
To do this,
we're introducing Face Sharing.

00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:35.756
You'll be able to discover curated faces
with third-party apps on the App Store,

00:47:35.822 --> 00:47:39.126
or discover a new favorite watch face
right on a website,

00:47:39.193 --> 00:47:42.296
or receive watch faces
directly from friends and family.

00:47:42.362 --> 00:47:43.997
Let's take a look at how this works.

00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:48.602
When you see a watch face you'd like,
you just press "Add Apple Watch Face."

00:47:49.169 --> 00:47:51.772
If the watch face uses some apps
that you don't have yet,

00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:55.609
you'll be offered each one right here
so you can easily get them if you like.

00:47:55.676 --> 00:47:58.045
And the new face appears
right on your watch.

00:47:58.111 --> 00:48:00.581
If you'd like to share a face
you've created yourself,

00:48:00.647 --> 00:48:02.182
that's also really easy.

00:48:02.249 --> 00:48:04.284
Just long press on the face,

00:48:04.351 --> 00:48:07.321
tap "Share," pick a contact and send.

00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:11.959
Developers can offer preconfigured
watch faces right from their apps.

00:48:12.025 --> 00:48:15.329
You can even share watch faces
across social media.

00:48:15.395 --> 00:48:18.665
It's a great way for the community
of Apple Watch wearers to connect

00:48:18.732 --> 00:48:22.636
and help each other discover all the
amazing things Apple Watch is capable of.

00:48:22.703 --> 00:48:25.272
Next, let's talk about Maps.

00:48:25.339 --> 00:48:29.009
Maps is great for walking, driving
and transit directions,

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:32.479
and now in watchOS, just like in iOS 14,

00:48:32.546 --> 00:48:34.281
you can get cycling directions.

00:48:35.148 --> 00:48:36.783
You'll see a variety of routes

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.887
with information like time, distance

00:48:39.953 --> 00:48:41.622
and whether there are bike lanes.

00:48:42.823 --> 00:48:45.959
You can preview travel time
and elevation changes

00:48:46.026 --> 00:48:49.997
and navigate with turn-by-turn directions
that are large and easy to read.

00:48:50.697 --> 00:48:53.700
Maps can direct you to dismount
and walk your bike

00:48:53.767 --> 00:48:56.036
or even take the stairs to save time.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:00.007
You can also search for and add places
optimized for cyclists,

00:49:00.073 --> 00:49:01.341
like bike repair shops.

00:49:01.408 --> 00:49:02.276
[chimes]

00:49:02.342 --> 00:49:05.045
Now to tell you about
how we're advancing Workouts,

00:49:05.345 --> 00:49:07.381
please welcome Julz Arney.

00:49:07.814 --> 00:49:09.082
Thanks, Kevin.

00:49:09.149 --> 00:49:11.718
The Workout app uses algorithms
that are smartly tuned

00:49:11.785 --> 00:49:13.720
to track all aspects of your training.

00:49:14.121 --> 00:49:16.123
It's one of the most used apps
on Apple Watch,

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:19.793
and we've continued to add support
for new workout types every year.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:23.397
-And in watchOS 7 we're adding Dance.
-[dance music playing]

00:49:23.463 --> 00:49:26.066
Dance is a total body workout
that's great for your heart.

00:49:26.133 --> 00:49:29.803
It makes you more fit and flexible,
and you're guaranteed to have fun.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:35.008
Whether you're doing Hip Hop, Latin,
Bollywood, or simply Cardio Dance,

00:49:35.075 --> 00:49:36.310
the Workout app now tracks

00:49:36.376 --> 00:49:39.513
some of the world's most popular
styles of dance for fitness.

00:49:40.247 --> 00:49:43.650
Getting the most accurate credit for Dance
presented a unique challenge.

00:49:43.717 --> 00:49:46.854
Arm movements aren't always repetitive
or synchronized with leg movements

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.789
like in running and walking.

00:49:48.856 --> 00:49:51.458
The solution was to use
advanced sensor fusion.

00:49:51.525 --> 00:49:52.526
[music continues]

00:49:52.593 --> 00:49:55.696
In Dance, we combine data from
the accelerometer and the gyroscope

00:49:55.762 --> 00:49:58.565
to detect the difference between
dancing with just your arms...

00:49:59.533 --> 00:50:00.834
just your lower body...

00:49:59.533 --> 00:50:00.834
just your lower body...

00:50:02.135 --> 00:50:05.539
or when you put it all together
and dance with your entire body.

00:50:05.606 --> 00:50:06.974
Then we add in heart rate data

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.843
for the most accurate
calorie burn calculations.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.847
watchOS 7 also tracks accurate calories
for Core Training,

00:50:13.914 --> 00:50:16.383
those exercises for your abs and back,

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:17.751
Functional Strength Training,

00:50:17.818 --> 00:50:21.855
a workout type that helps you get stronger
and move better for everyday activities,

00:50:21.922 --> 00:50:23.123
and also Cooldowns

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:24.725
to add on to another workout

00:50:24.791 --> 00:50:27.227
when you want to continue
with easy moves and stretches

00:50:27.294 --> 00:50:29.863
as you bring your heart rate
and breathing back to normal.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.333
Of course, you can track your progress
for any of these new workouts

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.369
inside the Activity app on iPhone,

00:50:35.435 --> 00:50:38.272
which is completely redesigned
in watchOS 7.

00:50:38.338 --> 00:50:40.140
The app now features a new Summary tab

00:50:40.207 --> 00:50:42.843
that gives you an easy way
to see your activity history,

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:45.946
workouts and trends,
all in one seamless view.

00:50:46.013 --> 00:50:49.049
With a new focus on easy navigation
and summary metrics,

00:50:49.116 --> 00:50:51.118
the app is getting a new name as well:

00:50:51.185 --> 00:50:52.486
[music continues]

00:50:52.553 --> 00:50:53.921
Fitness.

00:50:53.987 --> 00:50:55.722
Back to you, Kevin.

00:50:56.523 --> 00:50:57.791
-[record scratches]
-[music ends]

00:50:58.158 --> 00:50:59.226
Thanks, Julz.

00:50:59.626 --> 00:51:02.062
Apple Watch helps you meet
not only your fitness goals,

00:51:02.129 --> 00:51:03.897
but also helps support your health

00:51:03.964 --> 00:51:08.202
with features such as Cycle Tracking,
the Breathe app, and Noise notifications.

00:51:08.268 --> 00:51:12.072
And we're going to be adding even more
capabilities this year in watchOS 7.

00:51:12.139 --> 00:51:14.274
We'd like to share a couple of them
with you today,

00:51:14.341 --> 00:51:17.578
starting with one of the most-requested
features for Apple Watch:

00:51:17.945 --> 00:51:19.413
tracking your sleep.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.115
To tell you about this, over to Vera Carr.

00:51:22.749 --> 00:51:23.884
Thanks, Kevin.

00:51:23.951 --> 00:51:28.188
There are many ways to look at sleep:
scores, advanced monitoring,

00:51:28.255 --> 00:51:30.324
or sleep cycle analysis.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.993
We are taking
a more holistic approach to sleep

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:36.096
by leveraging the devices you use
every day

00:51:36.163 --> 00:51:37.865
to not only track your sleep

00:51:37.931 --> 00:51:41.668
but to support you in actually meeting
your sleep duration goal.

00:51:41.735 --> 00:51:45.305
That starts with choosing not only when
you would like to wake up in the morning,

00:51:45.372 --> 00:51:47.574
but also when you'd like to go to bed.

00:51:48.008 --> 00:51:50.644
For most of us, setting a goal is easy.

00:51:50.711 --> 00:51:53.313
But getting to bed on time,
that's the hard part.

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.050
Experts say that establishing
a bedtime routine

00:51:57.117 --> 00:52:00.787
helps the body transition
from wakefulness to sleep.

00:52:00.854 --> 00:52:03.323
So we are offering Wind Down.

00:52:03.857 --> 00:52:07.261
It can help you get to bed on time
by minimizing distractions

00:52:07.327 --> 00:52:09.630
and creating a personalized routine.

00:52:10.097 --> 00:52:11.532
Let's look at how this works.

00:52:12.232 --> 00:52:14.168
In the evening, ahead of your bedtime,

00:52:14.234 --> 00:52:16.203
your phone can display
the Wind Down screen

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:19.473
to help you transition mentally
before you go to bed.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:24.044
It creates a calm lock screen experience
and turns on Do Not Disturb for you.

00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:26.346
You can also set up shortcuts

00:52:26.413 --> 00:52:30.417
for simple things you may like to do
to help you prepare for bed.

00:52:30.484 --> 00:52:33.153
These might include
using your favorite meditation app

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.589
or playing relaxing music.

00:52:35.956 --> 00:52:37.691
Once it's time for bed,

00:52:37.758 --> 00:52:41.128
your screen will dim and your watch
will go into Sleep Mode,

00:52:41.528 --> 00:52:42.996
which looks like this.

00:52:43.463 --> 00:52:46.967
The screen will be off during time in bed
so it won't bother you,

00:52:47.034 --> 00:52:50.170
and a tap displays this simple face.

00:52:50.237 --> 00:52:51.672
When it's time to wake up,

00:52:51.738 --> 00:52:55.509
you have a selection of gentle
and effective alarm sounds,

00:52:55.576 --> 00:53:00.781
or a silent Taptic-only wake-up alarm
so you don't disturb your partner.

00:53:00.848 --> 00:53:05.219
Once you're up, you'll see a friendly
greeting easing you into the day.

00:53:05.752 --> 00:53:07.788
It also shows your battery level

00:53:07.855 --> 00:53:10.324
so you can remember to charge
in the morning.

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:11.859
Apple Watch tracks your sleep

00:53:11.925 --> 00:53:14.728
using a machine-learning model
that senses your motion

00:53:14.795 --> 00:53:17.064
and even interprets the micro-movements

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:19.733
caused by the rise and fall
of your breath,

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.903
providing signals for when you're awake
and when you're asleep.

00:53:23.604 --> 00:53:26.006
There's an updated Sleep section
in the Health app,

00:53:26.073 --> 00:53:29.076
including a view of your trends over time.

00:53:29.743 --> 00:53:32.579
Sleep Schedules, Wind Down, and Sleep Mode

00:53:32.646 --> 00:53:37.384
are also available on iPhone,
without a watch, in iOS 14.

00:53:37.818 --> 00:53:40.721
We know you'll enjoy using
your watch throughout the day

00:53:40.787 --> 00:53:42.723
and now throughout the night.

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:44.525
Thanks, Vera.

00:53:44.591 --> 00:53:46.260
In addition to sleep keeping you healthy,

00:53:46.326 --> 00:53:49.863
there's another preventative-care item
that's so important, particularly now:

00:53:50.964 --> 00:53:52.099
handwashing.

00:53:52.866 --> 00:53:54.001
In watchOS 7,

00:53:54.067 --> 00:53:58.071
Apple Watch is the first watch
to deliver automatic detection

00:53:58.138 --> 00:54:01.708
when you start washing your hands
and sensing of how long you actually wash.

00:54:02.276 --> 00:54:04.578
Our approach here is using
machine-learning models

00:54:04.645 --> 00:54:07.080
to determine motion
which appears to be handwashing

00:54:07.147 --> 00:54:09.750
and then use audio
to confirm the sound of running water

00:54:09.816 --> 00:54:11.818
or squishing soap on your hands.

00:54:12.319 --> 00:54:15.088
During this, you'll get a little coaching
to do a good job.

00:54:15.689 --> 00:54:18.225
You'll see a countdown,
along with haptics and sounds,

00:54:18.292 --> 00:54:20.727
to make sure you wash
as long as you're supposed to.

00:54:20.794 --> 00:54:23.797
If you pause early,
there's a polite note to keep washing.

00:54:23.864 --> 00:54:26.667
And when you're done,
you'll see, hear and feel it.

00:54:27.467 --> 00:54:30.838
That's just some of what's coming
this year in watchOS 7,

00:54:30.904 --> 00:54:34.341
including discovering and sharing faces,
new workout types,

00:54:34.408 --> 00:54:36.176
sleep and handwashing detection,

00:54:36.243 --> 00:54:39.379
and other new capabilities
like Siri language translation.

00:54:40.113 --> 00:54:41.615
And that's Apple Watch.

00:54:41.682 --> 00:54:43.317
It's time for you to join Craig again

00:54:43.383 --> 00:54:46.019
to talk about something
that's important to all of us.

00:54:46.086 --> 00:54:47.254
Here we go!

00:54:48.622 --> 00:54:50.591
["I'm Getting Tired"
by Jacknife Lee playing]

00:55:28.395 --> 00:55:29.897
[song ends]

00:55:29.963 --> 00:55:33.500
At Apple, we believe
privacy is a fundamental human right.

00:55:33.567 --> 00:55:37.471
So we build it into our products
from the beginning of the design process.

00:55:38.505 --> 00:55:40.941
Privacy matters now more than ever.

00:55:41.008 --> 00:55:43.844
And because our devices contain
our most sensitive information,

00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:47.948
all of our product work is grounded
in a set of privacy principles.

00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:51.018
First, data minimization.

00:55:51.084 --> 00:55:53.287
We use innovative technologies
and techniques

00:55:53.353 --> 00:55:57.558
to minimize the personal data
we or anyone else can access.

00:55:57.624 --> 00:56:00.227
Second, on-device intelligence.

00:56:00.294 --> 00:56:01.695
We avoid data collection

00:56:01.762 --> 00:56:05.432
by processing as much of your information
on your device as we can

00:56:05.499 --> 00:56:07.467
rather than sending it to a server.

00:56:07.534 --> 00:56:09.436
Third, security.

00:56:09.903 --> 00:56:14.074
Security protections are foundational
to everything we do in privacy.

00:56:14.141 --> 00:56:17.044
And finally, transparency and control.

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:19.613
It helps you better understand
the data being collected

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:23.884
so that you can make your own choices
about how that data is used.

00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:26.587
These principles come together
across our products,

00:56:26.653 --> 00:56:29.857
in our hardware,
our software and our services.

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:35.562
At the end of the day, they result
in great privacy and great ease of use.

00:56:35.629 --> 00:56:38.565
A powerful example of this
is Sign in with Apple,

00:56:38.632 --> 00:56:41.635
which is designed for simplicity,
security and privacy.

00:56:41.702 --> 00:56:43.770
And since we launched it last year,

00:56:43.837 --> 00:56:46.940
users have created
over 200 million accounts

00:56:47.007 --> 00:56:50.677
across a wide variety of apps
and websites.

00:56:50.744 --> 00:56:54.114
And developers are seeing great usage
when they adopt it.

00:56:54.181 --> 00:56:55.415
For example,

00:56:55.482 --> 00:56:57.518
Kayak has integrated Sign in with Apple

00:56:57.584 --> 00:57:01.321
and found that their users are now
two times more likely to use it

00:57:01.388 --> 00:57:03.824
than any other sign-in provider.

00:57:04.291 --> 00:57:06.894
Now, one thing we hear a lot
with Sign in with Apple

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:10.664
is that people wish they could convert
their existing accounts to use it.

00:57:10.731 --> 00:57:15.169
So this year we're going to enable
developers to let you do just that.

00:57:15.235 --> 00:57:17.437
When you upgrade, you get the ease of use

00:57:17.504 --> 00:57:19.806
and built-in security
of Sign in with Apple

00:57:19.873 --> 00:57:22.376
while keeping the account
that you already have.

00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:27.414
This is another big year
of privacy improvements in our products.

00:57:27.481 --> 00:57:31.251
And to tell you more, here's Katie Skinner
and Erik Neuenschwander.

00:57:32.719 --> 00:57:33.687
Thanks, Craig.

00:57:33.754 --> 00:57:35.656
First let's talk about location.

00:57:35.722 --> 00:57:38.759
This year we're continuing to give you
even more control.

00:57:38.825 --> 00:57:41.628
In addition to the option
of sharing your precise location,

00:57:41.695 --> 00:57:45.132
you will have the option to only share
your approximate location with apps.

00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:48.368
We're also making changes
for mic and camera

00:57:48.435 --> 00:57:50.237
so you always know when you're recording.

00:57:50.671 --> 00:57:52.840
In addition to requiring your permission,

00:57:52.906 --> 00:57:56.610
this year we're adding more visibility
for current or recent mic or camera use.

00:57:56.677 --> 00:58:00.280
So if an app uses either one,
we'll indicate that in the status bar.

00:58:00.714 --> 00:58:02.449
[Katie] Next, let's talk about tracking.

00:58:02.516 --> 00:58:05.886
Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention
has been really successful on the web.

00:58:05.953 --> 00:58:09.022
And this year, we wanted to help you
with tracking in apps.

00:58:09.089 --> 00:58:13.360
We believe tracking should always be
transparent and under your control.

00:58:13.427 --> 00:58:14.728
So moving forward,

00:58:14.795 --> 00:58:17.898
App Store policy will require apps to ask
before tracking you

00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:20.801
across apps and websites
owned by other companies.

00:58:20.868 --> 00:58:23.136
[Erik] Last, let's talk about app privacy.

00:58:23.203 --> 00:58:26.073
Today we require that apps
have a privacy policy.

00:58:26.139 --> 00:58:28.709
Wouldn't it be great to even more quickly
and easily see

00:58:28.775 --> 00:58:31.545
a summary of an app's privacy practices
before you download it?

00:58:31.612 --> 00:58:34.381
Now, where have we seen
something like that before?

00:58:34.448 --> 00:58:36.850
For food, you have nutrition labels.

00:58:36.917 --> 00:58:40.354
You can see if it's packed with protein
or loaded with sugar, or maybe both,

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:41.955
all before you buy it.

00:58:42.022 --> 00:58:45.592
So we thought it would be great
to have something similar for apps.

00:58:45.659 --> 00:58:49.396
We're going to require each developer
to self-report their practices.

00:58:49.463 --> 00:58:51.665
[Katie] We'll show you what they tell us.

00:58:51.732 --> 00:58:54.968
You can see if the developer is collecting
a little bit of data on you

00:58:55.035 --> 00:58:56.737
or a lot of data,

00:58:56.803 --> 00:58:59.673
or if they're sharing data
with other companies to track you,

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:01.141
and much more.

00:59:01.208 --> 00:59:02.743
[Erik] We're going to put this information

00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:04.378
on product pages in the App Store.

00:59:04.444 --> 00:59:07.681
So for each app, you can see
highlights of their privacy information

00:59:07.748 --> 00:59:09.149
before you download it.

00:59:09.216 --> 00:59:11.885
And we're going to include this
in all of our App Stores.

00:59:11.952 --> 00:59:13.754
Back over to you, Craig.

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:15.322
Thanks, Katie and Erik.

00:59:15.389 --> 00:59:18.592
These are some of the ways we're
strengthening the privacy of our platforms

00:59:18.659 --> 00:59:21.862
and bringing new features
to give users even more control.

00:59:22.563 --> 00:59:26.166
And one of the places where
privacy matters most is your home.

00:59:26.867 --> 00:59:27.935
Like most of you,

00:59:28.001 --> 00:59:31.738
in the past few months I've spent
more time at home than I ever imagined.

00:59:31.805 --> 00:59:33.941
It's more clear than ever
just how important it is

00:59:34.007 --> 00:59:37.578
to live in a home
where the technology just works.

00:59:37.644 --> 00:59:41.615
That brings us to some great new features
we're bringing to the home this year.

00:59:41.682 --> 00:59:44.585
All of these features share
a few key attributes.

00:59:44.651 --> 00:59:47.921
First, anything we develop for the home
should be easy,

00:59:47.988 --> 00:59:50.157
from initial setup to everyday use,

00:59:50.224 --> 00:59:54.261
just like how a tap of your iPhone
can automatically configure an Apple TV.

00:59:54.328 --> 00:59:58.465
Second, home products should never
compromise your privacy.

00:59:58.532 --> 01:00:03.370
That's why your Siri requests use
a random identifier, not your Apple ID.

00:59:58.532 --> 01:00:03.370
That's why your Siri requests use
a random identifier, not your Apple ID.

01:00:03.437 --> 01:00:07.341
And finally, your devices should
all work better together,

01:00:07.407 --> 01:00:11.745
like how AirPlay lets you share
from your iPhone straight to the TV.

01:00:11.812 --> 01:00:15.516
And when things are easy, private
and work together seamlessly,

01:00:15.582 --> 01:00:17.050
your home is more enjoyable,

01:00:17.117 --> 01:00:19.753
whether you're watching TV,
listening to music

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.122
or getting the most
out of your smart devices.

01:00:22.189 --> 01:00:25.192
To tell you more
about what we have in store for the home,

01:00:25.259 --> 01:00:27.294
let me pass it to Yah Cason.

01:00:30.998 --> 01:00:32.099
Thanks, Craig.

01:00:32.165 --> 01:00:34.434
Let's start by talking about
the smart home.

01:00:34.501 --> 01:00:37.738
With HomeKit,
we've given developers a robust framework

01:00:37.804 --> 01:00:41.375
to create smart home accessories
that are remarkably easy to set up

01:00:41.441 --> 01:00:44.711
all while being end-to-end encrypted
to your Apple devices.

01:00:44.778 --> 01:00:48.448
Already there's a rich ecosystem
of devices available.

01:00:48.515 --> 01:00:50.951
But we want to make it even easier
to build products

01:00:51.018 --> 01:00:52.853
that work across more homes.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.755
So we formed an alliance

01:00:54.821 --> 01:00:58.125
and partnered with Amazon, Google
and other industry leaders

01:00:58.192 --> 01:01:01.762
to define a new interoperability
standard for the smart home.

01:01:01.828 --> 01:01:03.397
We open-sourced HomeKit

01:01:03.463 --> 01:01:07.367
to ensure its ease of use and privacy
are core to this effort.

01:01:07.434 --> 01:01:10.537
And any accessory using HomeKit
or this new standard

01:01:10.604 --> 01:01:13.774
will work incredibly well
across all your Apple devices.

01:01:13.841 --> 01:01:16.076
And you control it all in the Home app,

01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:18.812
the most secure way
to manage your smart home.

01:01:18.879 --> 01:01:22.015
Adding new devices to your home
has never been easier.

01:01:22.082 --> 01:01:24.985
Simply tap or scan to set up an accessory.

01:01:25.052 --> 01:01:28.188
And in iOS 14, after you add an accessory,

01:01:28.255 --> 01:01:30.524
the Home app will now suggest
useful automations

01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:33.227
so you can immediately
put your new device to work for you.

01:01:33.293 --> 01:01:35.896
Automations are rules
that set your home to autopilot,

01:01:35.963 --> 01:01:39.233
like automatically turning on
your porch lights when motion is detected

01:01:39.299 --> 01:01:41.902
or having the garage door open
as you arrive home.

01:01:41.969 --> 01:01:43.637
And now when you open the Home app,

01:01:43.704 --> 01:01:46.173
you'll see a new visual status
right up top

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.576
that prioritizes the accessories
which most need your attention.

01:01:49.643 --> 01:01:52.646
You can easily see if you've left
a door unlocked or the lights on

01:01:52.713 --> 01:01:54.081
and quickly control them.

01:01:54.147 --> 01:01:55.449
Let's take a closer look

01:01:55.516 --> 01:01:58.285
at one of the most popular categories
of HomeKit accessories:

01:01:58.352 --> 01:01:59.553
Lights.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.656
Millions of us have already added
smart bulbs to our homes,

01:02:02.723 --> 01:02:05.158
many of which can change color on demand.

01:02:05.225 --> 01:02:06.493
In iOS 14,

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.830
we're introducing a feature to help you
get the most out of those bulbs:

01:02:09.897 --> 01:02:11.732
Adaptive lighting.

01:02:11.798 --> 01:02:15.135
Adaptive lighting automatically adjusts
the color temperature of your lights

01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:16.470
throughout the day.

01:02:16.537 --> 01:02:19.173
Turn it on to ease into the morning
with warm colors,

01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:21.808
stay focused and alert midday
with cooler ones,

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:24.611
and wind down at night
by reducing blue light.

01:02:24.678 --> 01:02:28.448
Adaptive lighting ensures
you get the right color at the right time.

01:02:28.515 --> 01:02:32.286
Another popular smart home category
is cameras.

01:02:32.352 --> 01:02:35.622
With HomeKit Secure Video
your cameras are completely private.

01:02:35.689 --> 01:02:40.060
And in iOS 14, we're making your cameras
work even harder for you.

01:02:40.127 --> 01:02:44.398
You'll be able to define Activity Zones
that focus on the most important areas.

01:02:44.464 --> 01:02:46.366
This is great if you face a busy sidewalk

01:02:46.433 --> 01:02:50.037
and only want to be alerted when people
actually walk up to your front door.

01:02:50.637 --> 01:02:54.808
Another powerful feature we're bringing
to cameras is face recognition.

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:59.546
HomeKit cameras and video doorbells will
now provide even richer notifications,

01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:02.249
telling you who's there
by leveraging the friends and family

01:03:02.316 --> 01:03:04.184
you've already tagged in your Photos app.

01:03:04.251 --> 01:03:08.755
And face recognition extends to HomePod,
announcing who's at the door.

01:03:08.822 --> 01:03:12.926
And with Apple TV, you'll get a live view
whenever someone rings the bell.

01:03:13.727 --> 01:03:19.199
In fact, all your HomeKit-enabled cameras
will be directly integrated with tvOS 14

01:03:19.266 --> 01:03:22.669
so you can quickly bring them up
in the new home view in Control Center.

01:03:22.736 --> 01:03:26.173
Or just ask Siri to pull up any camera
at any time.

01:03:26.607 --> 01:03:28.942
You can even take any camera full-screen,

01:03:29.009 --> 01:03:31.545
giving you a great view
of what's going on.

01:03:31.612 --> 01:03:34.414
And we have even more coming to tvOS 14.

01:03:34.481 --> 01:03:37.251
Now let me pass it to Cindy Lin
to tell you about it.

01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:38.652
Thanks, Yah.

01:03:39.453 --> 01:03:44.224
Apple TV is my favorite way to unwind
and enjoy entertainment with the family.

01:03:44.291 --> 01:03:46.593
With 4K, HDR,

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.795
Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos,

01:03:48.862 --> 01:03:52.533
you get a theater-like experience
right in your living room,

01:03:52.599 --> 01:03:56.036
making all your movies and shows
look and sound amazing.

01:03:56.103 --> 01:03:58.705
But Apple TV goes beyond video.

01:03:58.772 --> 01:04:01.875
You can access
the entire Apple Music collection

01:04:01.942 --> 01:04:04.044
and even sing along with timed lyrics.

01:04:04.444 --> 01:04:06.713
You can play
an incredible selection of games,

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.183
including all the games in Apple Arcade.

01:04:09.249 --> 01:04:12.452
And we're making gaming on Apple TV
even more personal

01:04:12.519 --> 01:04:14.755
by expanding multiuser support.

01:04:14.821 --> 01:04:18.926
Now you can instantly resume your games
exactly where you left off.

01:04:18.992 --> 01:04:21.695
Just open Control Center
to switch between users,

01:04:21.762 --> 01:04:25.432
and you can now see your game progress,
achievements and friends.

01:04:25.499 --> 01:04:27.968
And for even more fun,
we're adding support

01:04:28.035 --> 01:04:32.306
for Xbox Elite 2
and Xbox Adaptive Controllers.

01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:34.875
Apple TV
also helps you keep active at home

01:04:34.942 --> 01:04:36.977
with a great selection of fitness apps.

01:04:37.044 --> 01:04:38.979
And with tvOS 14,

01:04:39.046 --> 01:04:42.482
we're gonna make your workouts,
and everything you do on Apple TV,

01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:45.252
even more productive
by extending Picture in Picture

01:04:45.319 --> 01:04:47.888
across the entire Apple TV experience.

01:04:47.955 --> 01:04:52.226
So you can keep up with the news
or not miss a second of the big game.

01:04:52.292 --> 01:04:56.230
You can even have an AirPlay session
show up in a Picture in Picture window.

01:04:56.296 --> 01:04:58.632
And AirPlay is getting even better.

01:04:58.699 --> 01:05:02.402
Now the whole family can share
their stunning videos captured on iPhone

01:05:02.469 --> 01:05:05.105
in their full 4K resolution.

01:05:05.172 --> 01:05:07.774
With videos, music, games and more,

01:05:07.841 --> 01:05:11.078
Apple TV truly offers something
for everyone.

01:05:11.144 --> 01:05:14.948
Of course, nothing compares
to being captivated by a good story.

01:05:15.015 --> 01:05:19.286
And we've built a service for just that:
Apple TV+.

01:05:19.353 --> 01:05:23.590
We've already created
an incredible lineup of Apple Originals.

01:05:23.657 --> 01:05:26.360
And you can watch them all
in the Apple TV app,

01:05:26.426 --> 01:05:29.263
which is available
on your favorite Apple devices,

01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:31.331
on all major streaming boxes

01:05:31.398 --> 01:05:33.767
and many popular smart TVs.

01:05:33.834 --> 01:05:36.570
It's already reaching
over a billion screens.

01:05:37.137 --> 01:05:40.641
And it's coming to Sony and Vizio
smart TVs later this summer.

01:05:41.275 --> 01:05:45.612
Today, we're really excited
to tell you about a new Apple TV+ Original

01:05:45.679 --> 01:05:47.281
that we're working on.

01:05:47.347 --> 01:05:49.149
Almost 70 years ago,

01:05:49.216 --> 01:05:53.320
Isaac Asimov introduced the world
to a series of epic novels

01:05:53.387 --> 01:05:56.924
that spanned hundreds of worlds
and thousands of years.

01:05:56.990 --> 01:06:01.495
Many consider it to be the best
science-fiction series of all time.

01:06:01.562 --> 01:06:04.231
I'd like to share a sneak peek
with you now.

01:06:04.298 --> 01:06:06.600
This is Foundation.

01:06:08.235 --> 01:06:10.370
[dramatic music playing]

01:06:24.785 --> 01:06:26.587
They're going to arrest me tomorrow.

01:06:27.621 --> 01:06:29.790
And you. It's almost a certainty.

01:06:35.929 --> 01:06:38.131
<i>You're familiar with my work,
psychohistory?</i>

01:06:38.198 --> 01:06:40.567
Yes, in theory.
But I don't know what it has to do with--

01:06:40.634 --> 01:06:41.902
It's not a theory.

01:06:46.406 --> 01:06:48.742
[Salvor] <i>They're worried
you can predict the future.</i>

01:06:48.809 --> 01:06:50.410
[whirring]

01:06:52.613 --> 01:06:54.982
[Hari]
They're worried people believe I can.

01:06:55.048 --> 01:06:56.650
[whirring]

01:06:59.319 --> 01:07:01.321
And they don't like the future I predict.

01:07:07.461 --> 01:07:08.595
The empire will fall.

01:07:09.897 --> 01:07:11.498
Order will vanish.

01:07:12.933 --> 01:07:15.769
There's massive events rushing to meet us.

01:07:20.374 --> 01:07:22.643
[Salvor] Only we can shorten the darkness.

01:07:35.389 --> 01:07:37.057
[music fades]

01:07:44.498 --> 01:07:49.403
Wow. I'm super excited to watch Foundation
when it comes to Apple TV+ next year.

01:07:49.469 --> 01:07:53.140
With Apple TV, your home
has never been more entertaining.

01:07:53.941 --> 01:07:57.144
And with adaptive lighting,
face recognition for cameras

01:07:57.211 --> 01:07:58.946
and these other great features,

01:07:59.012 --> 01:08:01.348
your time at home
has never been more enjoyable.

01:08:01.415 --> 01:08:03.483
Now let me hand it back to Craig.

01:08:09.556 --> 01:08:10.624
Welcome back.

01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:14.595
Now let's talk about some big changes
coming to macOS.

01:08:15.662 --> 01:08:17.030
Since its introduction,

01:08:17.097 --> 01:08:20.667
macOS has revolutionized the experience
of using a computer

01:08:20.734 --> 01:08:24.505
by combining incredible power
with incredible ease of use.

01:08:24.571 --> 01:08:27.474
And it's loved
by all different types of users,

01:08:27.541 --> 01:08:29.109
from families and students

01:08:29.176 --> 01:08:30.711
to creative pros,

01:08:30.777 --> 01:08:33.881
businesspeople
and, of course, software developers.

01:08:33.947 --> 01:08:36.850
And this year, we're taking
the macOS experience you love

01:08:36.917 --> 01:08:38.318
even further.

01:08:39.586 --> 01:08:41.054
But what should we call it?

01:08:41.121 --> 01:08:43.957
Well, if you're a student of macOS,
you know this question

01:08:44.024 --> 01:08:47.628
can only be answered by Apple's
legendary crack marketing team.

01:08:47.694 --> 01:08:49.997
Their drug-fueled,
minibus-driven vision quests

01:08:50.063 --> 01:08:51.732
have yielded some great names

01:08:51.798 --> 01:08:54.568
and, sadly, spawned a host of imitators.

01:08:54.635 --> 01:08:56.904
The truth is,
we can't responsibly continue

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.840
to inadvertently lead our competition
to copy these methods

01:08:59.907 --> 01:09:02.009
when they clearly can't handle the trip.

01:09:02.075 --> 01:09:05.479
So this year, we're leaving our process
shrouded in mystery

01:09:05.546 --> 01:09:08.148
and taking you straight
to the glorious destination.

01:09:08.215 --> 01:09:12.319
Our next release of macOS
is macOS Big Sur.

01:09:13.187 --> 01:09:16.390
macOS Big Sur introduces
an entirely new design

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:20.561
and major updates to some of
the most essential apps on the platform.

01:09:20.627 --> 01:09:22.129
And just like its name,

01:09:22.196 --> 01:09:25.766
Big Sur brings you unmatched levels
of power and beauty.

01:09:26.567 --> 01:09:28.569
Let's start with design,

01:09:28.635 --> 01:09:33.307
where we're making the biggest change
since the introduction of Mac OS X.

01:09:33.373 --> 01:09:36.577
To tell you more about the philosophy
and incredible craftsmanship

01:09:36.643 --> 01:09:37.978
behind the new design,

01:09:38.045 --> 01:09:40.514
here's a short video with Alan Dye.

01:09:41.248 --> 01:09:42.816
[piano playing]

01:09:46.353 --> 01:09:49.323
At Apple, design has always been
about great ideas.

01:09:49.389 --> 01:09:54.127
Those ideas then are developed
with this obsessive dedication to detail.

01:09:54.695 --> 01:09:57.798
If we care enough about all the details
that make up a product,

01:09:57.865 --> 01:10:01.068
then in the end
we will have designed an experience

01:09:57.865 --> 01:10:01.068
then in the end
we will have designed an experience

01:10:01.134 --> 01:10:03.036
that really feels like
there's no other way it could be.

01:10:03.103 --> 01:10:07.107
And the best example of this
is macOS Big Sur.

01:10:10.143 --> 01:10:13.881
Our goal was to bring even more clarity
to the design of the software

01:10:13.947 --> 01:10:17.751
while retaining the Mac's
powerful capability and ease of use.

01:10:17.818 --> 01:10:19.720
We started with the simplest of elements,

01:10:19.786 --> 01:10:24.124
from the shape of a corner radius
to refinements in buttons and controls.

01:10:26.093 --> 01:10:28.996
And we brought our unified language
of symbols to the Mac,

01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:31.999
making them more consistent
and easier to recognize.

01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:35.903
Depth, shading and translucency

01:10:35.969 --> 01:10:38.205
are used to create hierarchy.

01:10:38.272 --> 01:10:41.074
These new materials are rich,
and they're vibrant.

01:10:41.141 --> 01:10:43.210
They bridge light and dark.

01:10:44.011 --> 01:10:47.915
We've reduced visual complexity
to keep the focus on users' content.

01:10:49.283 --> 01:10:51.585
Buttons and controls appear
when you need them,

01:10:51.652 --> 01:10:53.253
and they recede when you don't.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:56.456
There's a new way
to access system-level controls

01:10:56.523 --> 01:10:59.960
and a unified space
for notifications and widgets.

01:11:00.027 --> 01:11:01.862
We've also created a new suite of sounds.

01:11:01.929 --> 01:11:05.766
They're familiar to the Mac,
but remastered and more refined.

01:11:05.832 --> 01:11:06.700
[pulses]

01:11:06.767 --> 01:11:09.102
[alert notifications chiming]

01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:12.139
We wanted consistency
throughout the ecosystem,

01:11:12.206 --> 01:11:15.909
so users can move fluidly
between their Apple devices.

01:11:15.976 --> 01:11:19.346
But we also love that Mac icons
have a deep history

01:11:19.413 --> 01:11:21.281
and a distinct look and feel.

01:11:22.015 --> 01:11:24.685
So we've retained
many of the highly crafted details

01:11:24.751 --> 01:11:27.821
and the playful elements
that make Mac icons unique.

01:11:30.123 --> 01:11:32.326
This OS reflects an important history.

01:11:33.026 --> 01:11:37.297
It's familiar, but it's also
entirely new in every detail.

01:11:38.966 --> 01:11:39.967
We love the Mac.

01:11:40.033 --> 01:11:43.237
It's the tool we use to make all the
products that we put out into the world.

01:11:44.605 --> 01:11:47.608
And macOS Big Sur is where it starts.

01:11:51.345 --> 01:11:54.248
[Craig] So that's the thinking
behind our new design.

01:11:54.314 --> 01:11:57.117
Now let me show it to you
in action with a demo.

01:12:00.454 --> 01:12:01.622
As Alan said,

01:12:01.688 --> 01:12:05.192
we've refined some of the most iconic
elements of the Mac experience.

01:12:05.259 --> 01:12:06.760
Let's start with the Dock.

01:12:06.827 --> 01:12:10.531
It has an elegant new design that floats
along the bottom of your desktop.

01:12:10.597 --> 01:12:13.634
And you'll notice that we've created
gorgeous new app icons

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.036
for all of your favorite apps.

01:12:16.103 --> 01:12:18.539
Speaking of apps,
let's take a look at the Finder.

01:12:18.605 --> 01:12:23.877
You notice it has a gorgeous new
top-to-bottom design for the sidebar,

01:12:23.944 --> 01:12:27.514
and it has a compact,
space-efficient toolbar.

01:12:27.581 --> 01:12:30.651
Makes it really easy
to get to all of your controls.

01:12:31.218 --> 01:12:34.354
Next, let's take a look at Mail.

01:12:34.421 --> 01:12:37.257
You can see that Mail has
all-new glyphs in the sidebar,

01:12:37.324 --> 01:12:40.227
and you may have noticed
that we've brought color back as well.

01:12:40.294 --> 01:12:42.529
Now, each app uses its own key color.

01:12:42.596 --> 01:12:46.633
That same color is used for the elegant
new rounded row selection style

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.502
here in the message list.

01:12:48.569 --> 01:12:51.471
Now, the toolbar makes it really easy
to get to all your controls.

01:12:51.538 --> 01:12:54.474
Check out how the search bar expands
as I click on it.

01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:56.710
And, of course,
other operations like filtering,

01:12:56.777 --> 01:12:59.146
they're just a click away.

01:12:59.213 --> 01:13:01.882
Next, let's take a look at Photos.

01:13:01.949 --> 01:13:03.784
It's just stunning.

01:13:03.851 --> 01:13:07.087
You can get to all your albums
and media types from the sidebar,

01:13:07.154 --> 01:13:09.289
and the photo grid is backed by Metal,

01:13:09.356 --> 01:13:11.525
so animations are super smooth

01:13:11.592 --> 01:13:14.695
whether I'm scrolling, transitioning

01:13:14.761 --> 01:13:18.232
or zooming all the way in
or all the way out.

01:13:18.632 --> 01:13:19.633
It's beautiful.

01:13:20.133 --> 01:13:23.504
Now we've refreshed the design
for all the apps on the system,

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:26.773
from apps like Calendar and Notes

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.377
to Podcasts and Music,
with its new Listen Now pane.

01:13:30.444 --> 01:13:35.148
And an all-new version of iWork
that features a simplified toolbar.

01:13:35.215 --> 01:13:37.851
You may have noticed
we've also updated the menu bar.

01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:41.788
It's now translucent and elegantly takes
on the color of your desktop picture.

01:13:42.523 --> 01:13:45.425
And we've updated the layout
of menus as well.

01:13:45.492 --> 01:13:48.328
We've given all the items
just a little bit more room to breathe.

01:13:48.395 --> 01:13:52.199
Now, on the Mac, we love our ability
to get directly at controls,

01:13:52.266 --> 01:13:54.735
like Wi-Fi or Sound.

01:13:54.801 --> 01:13:58.572
And you can see that we've reworked these
to be even more useful.

01:13:58.639 --> 01:14:00.541
But we've gone even further this year

01:14:00.607 --> 01:14:03.443
by giving you one place
to get at all your controls.

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:06.680
We've brought Control Center to the Mac.

01:14:06.747 --> 01:14:10.684
All of my controls are here,
and it's really easy to make adjustments.

01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:13.554
For instance,
I can change display brightness here

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.523
or I can click to dive in for more,

01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:18.992
like turning on Dark Mode
or activating Night Shift.

01:14:19.459 --> 01:14:22.129
And what's really cool is
that I can customize the menu bar

01:14:22.196 --> 01:14:23.730
with any of these controls.

01:14:23.797 --> 01:14:27.067
So, say I want one-click access
to Do Not Disturb.

01:14:27.568 --> 01:14:31.405
I can just click and drag it
right into my menu bar

01:14:31.471 --> 01:14:33.273
and customize just like that.

01:14:33.874 --> 01:14:36.710
Now we've also reinvented
Notification Center.

01:14:36.777 --> 01:14:40.280
You can access it by clicking on the time
in the upper right.

01:14:40.347 --> 01:14:42.549
And as you see, we now have a single view

01:14:42.616 --> 01:14:46.053
that brings your notifications and widgets
together all in one place.

01:14:46.119 --> 01:14:48.789
And we now group
related notifications together.

01:14:48.856 --> 01:14:52.492
You can easily expand them
to take a closer look

01:14:52.559 --> 01:14:55.562
or clear them all out in one step.

01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:58.332
And we're bringing our redesigned widgets
to the Mac.

01:14:58.398 --> 01:14:59.733
They're really beautiful.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.102
And you have all-new ways
to customize them.

01:15:02.169 --> 01:15:05.005
I'm just gonna click "Edit Widgets"
down here at the bottom.

01:15:05.072 --> 01:15:07.908
And you can see
I have a gallery of all my widgets,

01:15:07.975 --> 01:15:10.544
and they come in a variety of sizes.

01:15:10.611 --> 01:15:14.248
I can select between them just like this.

01:15:14.314 --> 01:15:16.717
And developers can bring
their own widgets as well,

01:15:16.783 --> 01:15:18.919
like this one here from Day One.

01:15:18.986 --> 01:15:20.587
Now adding widgets is easy.

01:15:21.188 --> 01:15:25.125
Let's start by adding,
say, the World Clock.

01:15:25.192 --> 01:15:27.528
Maybe I'll add Notes in.

01:15:27.594 --> 01:15:31.965
And it'd be kind of cool
to add my Reminders list as well.

01:15:33.166 --> 01:15:36.436
So that's a look at Widgets,
Notification Center

01:15:36.503 --> 01:15:39.072
and our all-new design in Big Sur.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:43.644
Next, there are exciting updates
for some of the most-used apps on the Mac.

01:15:44.278 --> 01:15:46.446
First, let's talk about Messages.

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:51.251
Messages on the Mac is designed to work
seamlessly with all of your devices,

01:15:51.318 --> 01:15:54.288
so your SMS and iMessage conversations
are in sync

01:15:54.354 --> 01:15:56.356
no matter what device you're using.

01:15:56.423 --> 01:15:59.193
Now this year we're taking Messages
to the next level

01:15:59.259 --> 01:16:00.861
with a ton of great new features.

01:16:01.428 --> 01:16:05.098
We're introducing powerful search
to help you find what you're looking for.

01:16:05.699 --> 01:16:09.937
We have a redesigned photo picker
to make sharing photos and videos easier.

01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:14.208
And Memoji. You can now create
and edit your Memoji right on your Mac.

01:16:14.274 --> 01:16:17.044
And Memoji stickers
bring personality to messages,

01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:20.547
giving you fun ways to express yourself
in all of your conversations.

01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:23.717
Messages effects helps you
celebrate special moments

01:16:23.784 --> 01:16:24.985
and get your point across.

01:16:25.052 --> 01:16:27.654
And you're also getting
pinned conversations

01:16:27.721 --> 01:16:30.958
that are synced across devices
so you can always get to them,

01:16:31.024 --> 01:16:33.093
along with new Groups enhancements.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.996
So that's what's coming
to Messages on Mac:

01:16:36.063 --> 01:16:38.498
powerful tools
to manage your conversations

01:16:38.565 --> 01:16:41.268
and new ways to express yourself.

01:16:41.802 --> 01:16:43.837
Next up, Maps.

01:16:43.904 --> 01:16:48.008
Apple Maps is the best way
to explore and navigate the world,

01:16:48.075 --> 01:16:50.110
whether you're planning a trip on the Mac

01:16:50.177 --> 01:16:53.013
or using turn-by-turn directions
on your iPhone.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:57.618
Today I'm excited to announce
an all-new version of Maps for the Mac.

01:16:58.051 --> 01:17:01.021
To start,
Maps features a stunning new design

01:17:01.088 --> 01:17:05.392
that makes it easy to find your way around
using Apple's detailed new map.

01:17:05.459 --> 01:17:07.027
And for the first time on the Mac,

01:17:07.094 --> 01:17:10.864
Favorites like home, work
or that great coffee shop on the corner

01:17:10.931 --> 01:17:13.433
are now just a click away.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.370
You can now create your own Guides
of all the places you want to visit

01:17:16.436 --> 01:17:17.971
right on your Mac.

01:17:18.038 --> 01:17:19.806
And before leaving for the airport,

01:17:19.873 --> 01:17:22.910
you can check where your gate is located
with indoor maps

01:17:22.976 --> 01:17:25.746
or explore your destination city
with Look Around,

01:17:25.812 --> 01:17:28.115
which is incredible on the big screen.

01:17:28.182 --> 01:17:31.051
We've even brought
other useful features to the Mac,

01:17:31.118 --> 01:17:33.320
like the ability to see
the progress of friends

01:17:33.387 --> 01:17:35.022
who have shared their ETA with you.

01:17:35.622 --> 01:17:38.158
And the Mac gets
all the other new Maps features

01:17:38.225 --> 01:17:40.494
we just introduced in iOS 14.

01:17:41.428 --> 01:17:47.000
And that's just a taste of what's coming
in the all-new Apple Maps on the Mac.

01:17:47.067 --> 01:17:50.604
Next let's talk about Mac Catalyst.

01:17:50.671 --> 01:17:52.940
Catalyst gives developers a big head start

01:17:53.006 --> 01:17:55.609
in creating a Mac app from an iPad app.

01:17:55.676 --> 01:17:58.779
Take, for instance, our recent release
of Swift Playgrounds for Mac.

01:17:58.846 --> 01:18:01.648
Catalyst gave us a big head start
creating the app,

01:18:01.715 --> 01:18:03.884
and we were able
to spend our development time

01:18:03.951 --> 01:18:06.353
crafting a great Mac experience.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.157
Today we have some improvements
to Mac Catalyst I'd like to share.

01:18:10.724 --> 01:18:13.327
This year, developers will be able
to optimize their apps

01:18:13.393 --> 01:18:15.863
to fully utilize the native resolution
of the Mac screen,

01:18:15.929 --> 01:18:19.333
providing total control of every pixel.

01:18:19.399 --> 01:18:21.768
We've also given developers
new capabilities,

01:18:21.835 --> 01:18:25.138
including powerful new menu
and keyboard APIs

01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:28.509
and updated controls
like checkboxes and date pickers.

01:18:28.575 --> 01:18:31.645
They look great
with the new design of macOS.

01:18:31.712 --> 01:18:34.948
In fact, we used Catalyst
with the new version of Maps.

01:18:35.015 --> 01:18:36.483
And just as you'd expect,

01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:38.952
it's a full-fledged Mac app
that runs natively

01:18:39.019 --> 01:18:41.221
and is designed
in a way that's true to the Mac.

01:18:41.288 --> 01:18:45.158
So you get multiple resizable windows,
keyboard shortcuts

01:18:45.225 --> 01:18:48.896
and everything else you'd expect
from a native Mac app.

01:18:48.962 --> 01:18:51.565
And we did the same thing for Messages.

01:18:51.632 --> 01:18:54.301
Maps and Messages join
the great set of apps from Apple

01:18:54.368 --> 01:18:57.070
that already use
the Mac Catalyst technology.

01:18:57.137 --> 01:18:59.873
And there's a growing list
of third-party Catalyst apps available

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:01.942
on the Mac App Store.

01:19:02.476 --> 01:19:05.245
Next... Safari.

01:19:05.312 --> 01:19:06.513
Our users love Safari

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.616
for its speedy performance,
power efficiency

01:19:09.683 --> 01:19:12.486
and state-of-the-art privacy protections.

01:19:12.553 --> 01:19:13.954
And it delivers all of that

01:19:14.021 --> 01:19:17.991
while making it easy to get to your
bookmarks, tabs and browsing history

01:19:18.058 --> 01:19:19.660
across all of your devices.

01:19:19.726 --> 01:19:22.896
This year, we're building
on Safari's amazing performance,

01:19:22.963 --> 01:19:26.233
elegant design
and pioneering privacy protections

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:30.804
to deliver the biggest update to Safari
since it was first introduced.

01:19:30.871 --> 01:19:35.909
As you know, Safari has long been
the world's fastest desktop browser.

01:19:35.976 --> 01:19:39.346
This year, Safari's performance
running JavaScript is better than ever

01:19:39.413 --> 01:19:43.817
and continues to significantly outpace
all other major browsers.

01:19:44.351 --> 01:19:48.989
And now, when it comes to page loading,
we're even faster there too.

01:19:49.056 --> 01:19:51.692
In fact, when loading
frequently visited websites,

01:19:51.758 --> 01:19:55.963
Safari is now on average
more than 50% faster than Chrome.

01:19:56.029 --> 01:19:58.699
And Safari delivers
this amazing performance

01:19:58.765 --> 01:20:01.869
while continuing to deliver
industry-leading battery life.

01:19:58.765 --> 01:20:01.869
while continuing to deliver
industry-leading battery life.

01:20:02.503 --> 01:20:04.938
And of course,
Safari is continuing to build

01:20:05.005 --> 01:20:09.009
on its pioneering track record
of protecting user privacy.

01:20:09.076 --> 01:20:13.447
Safari was the first browser to introduce
private browsing, cookie blocking,

01:20:13.514 --> 01:20:16.483
and most recently,
Intelligent Tracking Prevention.

01:20:17.284 --> 01:20:20.387
This year, we want to give our users
even more visibility

01:20:20.454 --> 01:20:23.190
into how each site they visit
tries to track them

01:20:23.257 --> 01:20:25.993
and the ways that Safari protects them.

01:20:26.059 --> 01:20:29.062
So now users can click on
the Privacy Report button in the toolbar

01:20:29.129 --> 01:20:30.163
when they visit a site

01:20:30.230 --> 01:20:33.333
to better understand
how that site is treating their privacy.

01:20:34.168 --> 01:20:36.370
In addition to monitoring
unwanted tracking,

01:20:36.436 --> 01:20:40.374
Safari now also securely monitors
your saved passwords

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.810
to ensure that they haven't been
compromised in a data breach.

01:20:44.311 --> 01:20:47.714
And this is also a big year
for extensions in Safari.

01:20:47.781 --> 01:20:49.983
We're adding support
for the WebExtensions API

01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:52.319
so developers can easily
bring over extensions

01:20:52.386 --> 01:20:54.488
that they built for other browsers.

01:20:54.555 --> 01:20:57.224
And we're building an all-new category
in the Mac App Store

01:20:57.291 --> 01:21:01.662
to showcase Safari extensions
so users can easily find them.

01:21:01.728 --> 01:21:03.897
Now extensions are very powerful

01:21:03.964 --> 01:21:06.400
but can introduce privacy challenges.

01:21:06.466 --> 01:21:10.103
In other browsers, extensions can access
every page you visit,

01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:11.705
every tab you open,

01:21:11.772 --> 01:21:13.340
even everything you type.

01:21:13.407 --> 01:21:15.909
So we're doing even more here.

01:21:16.476 --> 01:21:20.414
In Safari, you choose
which sites each extension can work with,

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:23.851
and you can even give them access
just for the day,

01:21:23.917 --> 01:21:26.653
just for the website or all the time.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.355
But improved performance,

01:21:28.422 --> 01:21:32.526
power efficiency and privacy protections
are only the start.

01:21:32.593 --> 01:21:34.862
We have a whole slew
of new features this year.

01:21:34.928 --> 01:21:37.130
From a customizable start page

01:21:37.197 --> 01:21:40.701
to redesigned tabs
that are more elegant and powerful,

01:21:40.767 --> 01:21:45.939
and native translation capabilities
built right into Safari.

01:21:46.006 --> 01:21:49.643
To tell you more,
I'll hand it off to Beth Dakin.

01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:51.345
Thanks, Craig.

01:21:51.411 --> 01:21:54.648
I'm so excited to give you
a tour of the brand-new Safari.

01:21:54.715 --> 01:21:58.485
When you open Safari,
right away you'll notice the new look.

01:21:58.552 --> 01:22:00.053
It's clean and fresh.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.556
I want to show you
one of my favorite new features:

01:22:02.623 --> 01:22:03.991
the customizable start page.

01:22:04.057 --> 01:22:05.959
I love it because I can make it my own.

01:22:06.026 --> 01:22:08.095
It's easy to get to
the customization controls

01:22:08.161 --> 01:22:09.630
here in the bottom corner.

01:22:09.696 --> 01:22:12.766
We think a lot of people are gonna want
to set a background image,

01:22:12.833 --> 01:22:17.104
and there's a beautiful gallery
of curated wallpapers to choose from.

01:22:17.171 --> 01:22:21.041
You can use one of your own photos, too,
and I know I want a photo of my son.

01:22:21.108 --> 01:22:23.877
I have a few really cute ones
here in the downloads.

01:22:23.944 --> 01:22:26.213
I can just drag and drop to set it.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.881
That is so perfect.

01:22:27.948 --> 01:22:30.450
You can add new sections
to the start page too.

01:22:30.517 --> 01:22:34.321
Let's add iCloud Tabs and Reading List.

01:22:34.388 --> 01:22:35.756
Let's take a look.

01:22:35.822 --> 01:22:37.591
There. This is perfect.

01:22:37.658 --> 01:22:40.561
I use Reading List all the time,
and now it's so easy to get to.

01:22:40.627 --> 01:22:44.031
Another way that you can dial in Safari
to suit your specific needs

01:22:44.097 --> 01:22:45.465
is with extensions.

01:22:45.532 --> 01:22:49.403
I can't wait for you developers
to bring your web extensions to Safari.

01:22:49.469 --> 01:22:53.140
I've gone ahead and downloaded
a few web extensions to take a peek.

01:22:53.207 --> 01:22:56.844
So let's go here to the Safari preferences
to enable them.

01:22:56.910 --> 01:23:01.615
And I'll enable Power Thesaurus
and Recipe Filter.

01:23:01.682 --> 01:23:03.650
So each of the extensions
that I just enabled

01:23:03.717 --> 01:23:05.652
now has its own button
here in the toolbar.

01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:08.188
Let me show you Recipe Filter.
I love this one.

01:23:08.255 --> 01:23:11.625
So this extension will search
the web page for a recipe,

01:23:11.692 --> 01:23:14.394
and if it finds one,
it will pop it up in a little card.

01:23:14.461 --> 01:23:17.831
It's been a great accelerator for me
when I'm building a grocery list.

01:23:18.232 --> 01:23:22.336
So the extension hasn't done anything yet
because I haven't granted permission.

01:23:22.402 --> 01:23:24.505
So let me click on the toolbar button,

01:23:24.571 --> 01:23:27.174
and I'm going to allow this extension
for one day.

01:23:27.241 --> 01:23:28.976
And when I click here, it'll do its thing.

01:23:29.042 --> 01:23:32.179
So here we go. And there it is. So useful.

01:23:32.246 --> 01:23:33.847
Okay, so I have my personality

01:23:33.914 --> 01:23:36.683
pretty thoroughly stamped
over Safari at this point.

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:39.353
And you know,
I use Safari for a lot of personal things,

01:23:39.419 --> 01:23:42.623
and Apple makes sure
my private life stays private.

01:23:42.689 --> 01:23:46.960
Privacy is essential to everything we do
at Apple, and it's critical on the web.

01:23:47.027 --> 01:23:49.897
And now you can see
what Safari is doing to protect you.

01:23:49.963 --> 01:23:52.766
If I click on the
Intelligent Tracking Prevention button,

01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:54.501
I can see the number of known trackers

01:23:54.568 --> 01:23:57.538
that Safari protected me from
on this web page.

01:23:57.604 --> 01:23:59.039
I can click here

01:23:59.106 --> 01:24:03.043
to see a list of the known trackers
right here in this popover.

01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:05.846
And the full privacy report
is just one click away.

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:09.049
And that's what we have for privacy
in the new Safari.

01:24:09.116 --> 01:24:11.018
Next I'd like to talk about tabs.

01:24:11.084 --> 01:24:13.720
If you love tabs,
you're going to love the new Safari.

01:24:13.787 --> 01:24:17.524
It's easier and more efficient than ever
to work with lots of tabs.

01:24:17.591 --> 01:24:19.560
So I have another window here,

01:24:19.626 --> 01:24:22.129
and right away you'll notice
that there are icons and tabs,

01:24:22.196 --> 01:24:25.365
which makes it so easy
to spot what you're looking for.

01:24:25.432 --> 01:24:30.804
And if I open more tabs,
then you'll see more of them at once

01:24:30.871 --> 01:24:35.209
because the tabs get smaller
and use the space more efficiently.

01:24:35.275 --> 01:24:38.011
If it's a little hard to find what
you're looking for with this many tabs,

01:24:38.078 --> 01:24:39.213
that's no problem.

01:24:39.279 --> 01:24:43.817
You can just hover over tabs
and see a nice preview of the page.

01:24:44.685 --> 01:24:46.987
I'm ready to clean up now,
and that's easy too.

01:24:47.054 --> 01:24:49.189
I can just bring up the context menu here

01:24:49.256 --> 01:24:51.758
and close all tabs to the right.
Just like that.

01:24:51.825 --> 01:24:55.729
We are so excited that
the new Safari has built-in translation.

01:24:55.796 --> 01:24:56.797
Let me show you.

01:24:57.598 --> 01:24:59.700
So here on this website, on El Mundo,

01:24:59.766 --> 01:25:03.070
Safari has detected
that this is not in my primary language,

01:25:03.136 --> 01:25:06.406
and it's added the translation icon
to the smart search field.

01:25:06.473 --> 01:25:10.077
I can click here,
and let's translate this page to English.

01:25:10.143 --> 01:25:11.612
It'll happen inline.

01:25:12.079 --> 01:25:14.147
And as more content is added,

01:25:14.214 --> 01:25:16.416
that gets translated dynamically too.

01:25:17.618 --> 01:25:20.787
Those are some highlights, but there is
so much more to the new Safari.

01:25:20.854 --> 01:25:22.022
Back to you, Craig.

01:25:22.089 --> 01:25:23.490
Thanks, Beth.

01:25:23.557 --> 01:25:25.192
So that's Safari.

01:25:25.259 --> 01:25:28.262
It's a huge release,
with new ways to customize,

01:25:28.328 --> 01:25:30.264
big improvements
to your browsing experience

01:25:30.330 --> 01:25:32.165
like tabs and translation,

01:25:32.232 --> 01:25:34.535
and even stronger privacy protection

01:25:34.601 --> 01:25:37.571
to keep your browsing your business.

01:25:38.539 --> 01:25:40.207
And that's macOS Big Sur,

01:25:40.274 --> 01:25:44.745
the biggest update to design since
the original introduction of Mac OS X,

01:25:44.811 --> 01:25:47.281
significant updates to Messages and Maps

01:25:47.347 --> 01:25:50.684
and the biggest update to Safari ever.

01:25:50.751 --> 01:25:53.086
But these changes are only the beginning.

01:25:53.153 --> 01:25:56.456
For years now,
down deep, below the surface,

01:25:56.523 --> 01:25:59.426
we've been working
on something truly profound.

01:25:59.493 --> 01:26:01.995
To tell you more,
I'll hand it back to Tim.

01:26:03.797 --> 01:26:05.065
Thanks, Craig.

01:26:05.132 --> 01:26:08.135
Big Sur is going to be
a great release of macOS.

01:26:08.202 --> 01:26:10.370
But that's only part of the story,

01:26:10.437 --> 01:26:15.209
because today is going to be
a truly historic day for the Mac.

01:26:15.275 --> 01:26:18.078
Today we're going to tell you
about some really big changes,

01:26:18.145 --> 01:26:21.181
how we're going to take the Mac
to a whole new level.

01:26:21.248 --> 01:26:22.583
From the very beginning,

01:26:22.649 --> 01:26:25.853
the Mac redefined
the entire computer industry.

01:26:25.919 --> 01:26:30.257
The Mac has always been about innovation
and boldly pushing things forward,

01:26:30.324 --> 01:26:33.927
embracing big changes to stay
at the forefront of personal computing.

01:26:35.128 --> 01:26:38.198
The Mac has had
three major transitions in its history.

01:26:38.899 --> 01:26:40.701
The move to PowerPC,

01:26:40.767 --> 01:26:43.070
the transition to Mac OS X

01:26:43.136 --> 01:26:45.239
and the move to Intel.

01:26:45.305 --> 01:26:50.110
And now it's time
for a huge leap forward for the Mac,

01:26:50.177 --> 01:26:54.081
because today is the day we're announcing
that the Mac is transitioning...

01:26:58.986 --> 01:27:01.121
to our own Apple Silicon.

01:27:02.389 --> 01:27:06.760
When we make bold changes,
it's for one simple yet powerful reason:

01:27:06.827 --> 01:27:09.096
so we can make much better products.

01:27:09.162 --> 01:27:12.299
When we look ahead,
we envision some amazing new products,

01:27:12.366 --> 01:27:15.002
and transitioning
to our own custom silicon

01:27:15.068 --> 01:27:17.271
is what will enable us
to bring them to life.

01:27:18.405 --> 01:27:19.606
At Apple,

01:27:19.673 --> 01:27:24.178
integrating hardware and software
is fundamental to everything we do.

01:27:24.244 --> 01:27:26.213
That's what makes our products so great.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.483
And silicon is at the heart
of our hardware.

01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:32.252
So having a world-class
silicon design team

01:27:32.319 --> 01:27:33.554
is a game changer.

01:27:34.555 --> 01:27:36.790
To tell you more about Apple Silicon

01:27:36.857 --> 01:27:39.259
and how it will take Mac
to the next level,

01:27:39.326 --> 01:27:42.496
I'd like to send you over to Johny Srouji

01:27:42.563 --> 01:27:45.699
at one of our labs
in an undisclosed location.

01:27:46.533 --> 01:27:48.535
["I'm Getting Tired"
by Jacknife Lee playing]

01:28:10.591 --> 01:28:11.692
[song ends]

01:28:11.758 --> 01:28:13.460
Welcome to our lab.

01:28:13.527 --> 01:28:17.030
We've been building and refining
our Apple Silicon for over a decade.

01:28:17.097 --> 01:28:18.999
The result is a scalable architecture

01:28:19.066 --> 01:28:21.235
that is custom-designed
for Apple products,

01:28:21.301 --> 01:28:24.471
and it leads the industry in features
and performance per watt.

01:28:24.538 --> 01:28:26.306
So I'd like to tell you how we got here

01:28:26.373 --> 01:28:28.609
and what it means for the Mac
moving forward.

01:28:28.675 --> 01:28:30.811
It all started with the iPhone.

01:28:30.878 --> 01:28:32.980
The iPhone demanded
performance and capabilities

01:28:33.046 --> 01:28:35.916
that were seen as impossible
in a device that small.

01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:40.187
This is where we developed our relentless
focus on performance per watt.

01:28:41.054 --> 01:28:44.324
Generation after generation,
we pushed the boundaries of technology,

01:28:44.391 --> 01:28:47.494
which enabled us to improve
performance and energy efficiency,

01:28:47.561 --> 01:28:50.531
while building advanced
and industry-leading features.

01:28:50.597 --> 01:28:55.335
Our team delivered ten generations
of increasingly complex and rich designs,

01:28:55.402 --> 01:28:57.538
always improving performance.

01:28:57.604 --> 01:28:59.907
In fact, CPU performance in the iPhone

01:28:59.973 --> 01:29:02.142
has improved by over a hundred times,

01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:06.180
keeping the iPhone's performance ahead
of every other phone in the industry.

01:29:06.246 --> 01:29:09.149
Another opportunity for the team
was the iPad.

01:29:09.216 --> 01:29:11.818
While iPhone chips
could drive our mainstream iPads,

01:29:11.885 --> 01:29:14.054
we wanted to push the iPad even further.

01:29:14.121 --> 01:29:16.423
It began with the iPad's Retina display,

01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:18.692
which demanded a custom chip.

01:29:18.759 --> 01:29:20.494
So the team scaled our architecture

01:29:20.561 --> 01:29:22.563
and designed the most-optimized

01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:25.766
and highest-performance chip
possible for the iPad.

01:29:25.832 --> 01:29:27.034
Starting with the A5X,

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:30.571
we built a line of SoCs
specifically designed for the iPad.

01:29:30.637 --> 01:29:33.740
We doubled the iPhone's
graphics performance through a larger GPU

01:29:33.807 --> 01:29:36.376
and a wider memory subsystem.

01:29:36.443 --> 01:29:39.079
This put the iPad in a class by itself.

01:29:39.146 --> 01:29:42.816
Compared to the very first iPad,
the latest iPad Pro delivers

01:29:42.883 --> 01:29:45.385
over 1,000 times faster
graphics performance

01:29:45.452 --> 01:29:47.354
in just ten years.

01:29:47.421 --> 01:29:50.157
This is part of the reason
why the iPad Pro is faster

01:29:50.224 --> 01:29:53.227
than the vast majority of PC laptops.

01:29:53.293 --> 01:29:57.698
And this foreshadows how well
our architecture will scale into the Mac.

01:29:57.764 --> 01:30:01.168
Another place where we applied our focus
was the Watch.

01:29:57.764 --> 01:30:01.168
Another place where we applied our focus
was the Watch.

01:30:01.235 --> 01:30:04.171
We scaled our SoC architecture
to optimize performance

01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:07.107
for the device's unique
low-power requirements,

01:30:07.174 --> 01:30:10.310
and we built a chip
perfectly suited for Apple Watch.

01:30:11.345 --> 01:30:14.681
Our SoCs enable each of these products
with unique features

01:30:14.748 --> 01:30:16.783
and industry-leading performance per watt,

01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:19.620
and it makes each of them best in class.

01:30:19.987 --> 01:30:22.689
And we do this at an enormous scale.

01:30:22.756 --> 01:30:26.660
In fact, adding all of the processors
across these three products,

01:30:26.727 --> 01:30:29.997
we've shipped over two billion
in just ten years.

01:30:30.063 --> 01:30:32.833
And we've designed and shipped
billions of additional chips

01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:34.535
that work together with our SoCs

01:30:34.601 --> 01:30:36.537
to enable our amazing products.

01:30:36.603 --> 01:30:39.139
And now we're bringing
all of that expertise

01:30:39.206 --> 01:30:42.042
and that same focused
and disciplined approach

01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:43.243
to the Mac.

01:30:43.644 --> 01:30:47.347
The first thing this will do is give
the Mac a whole new level of performance.

01:30:47.414 --> 01:30:50.984
Now, when we talk about performance,
we have to talk about power,

01:30:51.051 --> 01:30:54.555
because all systems built today
are constrained by power consumption,

01:30:54.621 --> 01:30:55.989
thermals, or both.

01:30:56.757 --> 01:30:58.759
Among today's consumer systems,

01:30:58.825 --> 01:31:01.028
desktops deliver the highest performance

01:31:01.094 --> 01:31:03.163
but consume the most power.

01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:05.899
Notebooks trade off performance
for lower power,

01:31:05.966 --> 01:31:07.601
making them portable.

01:31:07.668 --> 01:31:09.937
As you can see,
normally to get more performance

01:31:10.003 --> 01:31:12.239
you have to consume more power.

01:31:12.306 --> 01:31:14.274
When you take a closer look at this chart,

01:31:14.341 --> 01:31:17.744
you realize you want to operate
in the upper-left corner.

01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:20.047
You want to deliver
the highest performance

01:31:20.113 --> 01:31:22.049
at the lowest power consumption.

01:31:22.115 --> 01:31:24.618
And that's exactly
where we want to take the Mac.

01:31:25.118 --> 01:31:26.954
Building up on our years of experience

01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:29.790
designing the world's
most energy-efficient chips,

01:31:29.857 --> 01:31:33.093
our plan is to give the Mac
a much higher level of performance

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.163
while at the same time
consuming less power.

01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:38.332
So, much better performance
is reason enough

01:31:38.398 --> 01:31:40.534
to transition the Mac to Apple SoCs.

01:31:41.301 --> 01:31:43.270
But that's just part of the story.

01:31:44.071 --> 01:31:47.307
Our scalable architecture includes
many custom technologies

01:31:47.374 --> 01:31:49.443
that when integrated with our software

01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:51.912
will bring even more innovation
to the Mac.

01:31:52.646 --> 01:31:54.314
With our advanced power management,

01:31:54.381 --> 01:31:56.984
we will maximize performance
and battery life

01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:58.719
better than ever before.

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.923
Our Secure Enclave will bring
best-in-class security,

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:04.525
and our high-performance GPU

01:32:04.591 --> 01:32:08.428
is going to bring a whole new level
of graphics performance to every Mac,

01:32:08.495 --> 01:32:10.831
making them even better
for Pro Applications

01:32:10.898 --> 01:32:12.432
and really great for games.

01:32:12.499 --> 01:32:14.668
And combined with our neural engines,

01:32:14.735 --> 01:32:18.672
our chips will make the Mac
an amazing platform for machine learning.

01:32:18.739 --> 01:32:21.074
And we're bringing
many other custom technologies,

01:32:21.141 --> 01:32:24.545
such as our video-display
and image-processing engines,

01:32:24.611 --> 01:32:27.414
that will help make the Mac
better than ever before.

01:32:28.015 --> 01:32:29.950
So, what does all of this mean
for the Mac?

01:32:30.017 --> 01:32:34.421
First, we're designing a family of SoCs
specifically for the Mac product line.

01:32:34.488 --> 01:32:37.391
Second, just like we did
with the iPhone, iPad and Watch,

01:32:37.457 --> 01:32:40.227
we're going to bring
great technologies to the Mac.

01:32:40.294 --> 01:32:42.696
This will give the Mac
a unique set of features

01:32:42.763 --> 01:32:44.831
and incredible performance.

01:32:44.898 --> 01:32:47.034
And third, we'll have
a common architecture

01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:49.803
across all of our product lines,

01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:53.140
making it far easier for developers
to write and optimize software

01:32:53.207 --> 01:32:55.375
for the entire Apple ecosystem.

01:32:55.442 --> 01:32:58.512
Ultimately we know
that bringing our SoCs to the Mac

01:32:58.579 --> 01:33:01.748
will allow us to build
much better products,

01:33:01.815 --> 01:33:04.785
and the Mac will take
another huge leap forward.

01:33:04.852 --> 01:33:06.653
Now, a key advantage we have

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:10.057
is the tight integration
of our silicon with our software.

01:33:10.123 --> 01:33:13.360
To tell you more about
how macOS will run on Apple SoCs,

01:33:13.427 --> 01:33:15.295
here is my colleague, Craig.

01:33:17.364 --> 01:33:18.432
Thanks, Johny.

01:33:18.498 --> 01:33:22.870
Now let's talk about the technologies
that we've built into macOS Big Sur

01:33:22.936 --> 01:33:26.440
that will make the transition
to Apple Silicon smooth and seamless

01:33:26.507 --> 01:33:29.176
for both consumers and developers.

01:33:29.243 --> 01:33:32.145
These new Mac systems will be incredible,

01:33:32.212 --> 01:33:33.981
and users will want their favorite apps

01:33:34.047 --> 01:33:37.451
to take full advantage of the capabilities
of our custom silicon.

01:33:37.518 --> 01:33:40.521
And the best way to do that
is with native apps.

01:33:40.587 --> 01:33:43.156
So of course when we updated
our apps for Big Sur,

01:33:43.223 --> 01:33:47.361
we built everything as native
for Apple Silicon.

01:33:47.427 --> 01:33:50.364
And I'm happy to say we have
all of our own Apple apps,

01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:54.801
including our most demanding Pro Apps
like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro,

01:33:54.868 --> 01:33:57.070
up and running as native now,

01:33:57.137 --> 01:34:00.307
and they'll be ready for customers
on day one.

01:34:00.374 --> 01:34:01.909
So, how did we do this?

01:34:01.975 --> 01:34:05.145
We're using Xcode,
just like all our developers will.

01:34:05.212 --> 01:34:08.248
Everything developers need
to build apps for these new chips

01:34:08.315 --> 01:34:11.051
is built into the new version of Xcode.

01:34:11.118 --> 01:34:15.189
To get started, developers just open
their app projects and recompile.

01:34:15.255 --> 01:34:18.559
The vast majority of developers
can get their apps up and running

01:34:18.625 --> 01:34:21.161
in just a matter of days.

01:34:21.228 --> 01:34:23.096
And to deliver these apps,

01:34:23.163 --> 01:34:24.865
we've created Universal 2.

01:34:24.932 --> 01:34:26.567
It's a new type of Universal binary

01:34:26.633 --> 01:34:30.904
that works on both Intel-based Macs
and Macs built on Apple Silicon.

01:34:31.405 --> 01:34:35.375
So developers can tap into the native
power and performance of our new Macs

01:34:35.442 --> 01:34:37.911
and still support Intel-based Macs,

01:34:37.978 --> 01:34:41.114
all with a single binary
for all of their users.

01:34:41.181 --> 01:34:44.418
Some of the biggest Mac developers
have already gotten started.

01:34:44.484 --> 01:34:47.454
Microsoft is hard at work
on Office for the Mac.

01:34:47.521 --> 01:34:49.489
And we've been working with Adobe

01:34:49.556 --> 01:34:51.291
on their flagship Creative Cloud,

01:34:51.358 --> 01:34:55.128
and many of their apps
are already up and running great.

01:34:55.696 --> 01:34:59.333
So let's take a look at macOS
running on Apple Silicon.

01:34:59.399 --> 01:35:03.303
So here we are on the desktop
that we know and love.

01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:06.039
And I'm just gonna open up About This Mac.

01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:11.745
And what you see here is that we are
running on our Apple Development Platform.

01:35:11.812 --> 01:35:14.147
This is a system built
to support early development

01:35:14.214 --> 01:35:16.617
using the same A12Z processor

01:35:16.683 --> 01:35:19.219
currently shipping in iPad Pro.

01:35:19.286 --> 01:35:21.054
Now, I have a confession to make.

01:35:21.121 --> 01:35:24.358
This isn't the first time
you've seen macOS running here.

01:35:24.424 --> 01:35:26.426
In fact, this is the same Mac

01:35:26.493 --> 01:35:30.597
that Beth and I used to demo
all the new Big Sur features earlier.

01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:32.666
And as you saw earlier,

01:35:32.733 --> 01:35:35.068
we've updated all of our Apple apps

01:35:35.135 --> 01:35:37.104
and they're running great.

01:35:37.171 --> 01:35:40.974
Of course, a big part
of the Mac experience is third-party apps,

01:35:41.041 --> 01:35:43.577
and we've been working
with our friends at Microsoft,

01:35:43.644 --> 01:35:47.447
and they already have Office
up and running natively on our new Macs.

01:35:47.781 --> 01:35:49.283
Let's take a look at Word.

01:35:49.349 --> 01:35:50.717
It runs great.

01:35:50.784 --> 01:35:53.287
Scrolling is super smooth.

01:35:53.353 --> 01:35:56.924
Everything you do
is just super responsive.

01:35:57.324 --> 01:35:59.927
Next let's check out Excel.

01:36:00.794 --> 01:36:04.898
Just as you'd expect,
complex sheets and elements like this map

01:36:04.965 --> 01:36:07.301
all update instantly.

01:36:07.367 --> 01:36:10.204
And next let's take a look at PowerPoint.

01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:14.441
It's using Metal for rendering,
and it performs great.

01:36:14.508 --> 01:36:19.313
For instance, check out how I can see
all the layers of my slide in 3D.

01:36:19.379 --> 01:36:22.015
The animation is perfectly fluid.

01:36:22.449 --> 01:36:25.452
Now, we've also been working closely
with our friends at Adobe

01:36:25.519 --> 01:36:27.988
to bring Creative Cloud to our new Macs.

01:36:28.488 --> 01:36:31.491
Here's Lightroom
running native on Apple Silicon.

01:36:31.992 --> 01:36:37.231
Navigating large libraries of DNG images
is super fast,

01:36:37.297 --> 01:36:41.468
and all of Lightroom's editing controls
are available right here.

01:36:41.535 --> 01:36:43.737
Let's apply an adjustment to this image.

01:36:43.804 --> 01:36:44.838
Well, that's much better.

01:36:44.905 --> 01:36:50.143
And we can apply that same edit
to all of these images in a single step.

01:36:51.411 --> 01:36:52.713
Looks great.

01:36:52.779 --> 01:36:56.049
Next, let me show you the app
I know many of you wanna see:

01:36:56.116 --> 01:36:57.484
Photoshop.

01:36:57.551 --> 01:37:02.256
Here is a five-gigabyte Photoshop file
by photographer Stephen Wilkes.

01:37:02.322 --> 01:37:06.793
Now this is a heavy-duty document
with lots of layers.

01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:09.463
Now let's add one more bird in there.

01:37:10.998 --> 01:37:14.801
Not totally comfortable with the level of
social distancing, but let's keep going.

01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:19.306
And let's check out
how smooth the animation is as I zoom out.

01:37:20.507 --> 01:37:22.176
Wow. Beautiful.

01:37:22.809 --> 01:37:26.013
Finally, let's turn to
one of our most sophisticated apps:

01:37:26.079 --> 01:37:27.414
Final Cut Pro.

01:37:27.481 --> 01:37:30.584
Here it is running on Apple Silicon
for the first time.

01:37:30.651 --> 01:37:32.953
Let's play back some 4K video.

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:36.123
As you can see, playback is super smooth.

01:37:36.190 --> 01:37:39.259
And all your filters are here,
and you can apply them in real time.

01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:41.929
Let's try some color correction.

01:37:41.995 --> 01:37:46.066
And I can even add
animated titles and lens flare...

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.769
all during live playback.

01:37:48.836 --> 01:37:50.270
And Final Cut takes advantage

01:37:50.337 --> 01:37:52.806
of the unique capabilities
of the Apple Neural Engine

01:37:52.873 --> 01:37:56.610
with a new feature that analyzes video
and intelligently crops it

01:37:56.677 --> 01:37:59.279
to keep the most important action
in the frame.

01:37:59.346 --> 01:38:00.814
But that's not all.

01:38:00.881 --> 01:38:04.518
Final Cut fully exploits
the system's multicore architecture

01:38:04.585 --> 01:38:08.188
to let us play back not just one or two,
but three streams

01:38:08.255 --> 01:38:13.694
of full-resolution 4K ProRes,
all on an A12Z processor.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:14.828
Amazing.

01:38:15.162 --> 01:38:18.932
So that's a first look
at Universal apps on Apple Silicon.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:23.270
We're really excited to see
so much great work on native apps.

01:38:23.837 --> 01:38:26.773
These apps even get more amazing
when they're built to take advantage of

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:28.775
the Silicon's powerful capabilities.

01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:31.845
Like its incredible
CPU and graphics performance,

01:38:31.912 --> 01:38:34.948
a unified memory architecture
and the Neural Engine

01:38:35.015 --> 01:38:37.684
which accelerates
advanced machine-learning tasks.

01:38:37.751 --> 01:38:40.621
The transition to Apple Silicon
is also great for developers

01:38:40.687 --> 01:38:44.124
who've already optimized their apps
for other Apple platforms.

01:38:44.191 --> 01:38:46.059
The shared architecture
across our products

01:38:46.126 --> 01:38:49.997
means that their code
will absolutely sing on our new Macs.

01:38:50.697 --> 01:38:52.332
And there's even more to the story.

01:38:52.399 --> 01:38:53.934
We're doing some really important things

01:38:54.001 --> 01:38:56.470
to make this transition
seamless for our users.

01:38:57.237 --> 01:39:00.407
Now, while we expect most developers
will go native immediately,

01:39:00.474 --> 01:39:04.077
we wanna make sure that users
can run all of their apps on day one,

01:39:04.144 --> 01:39:06.513
even if some apps
haven't yet been updated.

01:39:07.214 --> 01:39:09.416
Now, we've been down this road before.

01:39:09.483 --> 01:39:12.452
When we transitioned
from PowerPC to Intel processors,

01:39:12.519 --> 01:39:15.822
a cornerstone of that transition
was Rosetta,

01:39:15.889 --> 01:39:20.661
a technology that makes it possible
to run PowerPC apps on Intel-based Macs.

01:39:21.161 --> 01:39:25.666
macOS Big Sur will include
a new version of Rosetta, Rosetta 2.

01:39:25.732 --> 01:39:28.869
Rosetta 2 automatically
translates your existing Mac apps

01:39:28.936 --> 01:39:31.438
so they work on new Macs
with Apple Silicon.

01:39:31.939 --> 01:39:37.411
And this time Rosetta is even faster,
more powerful and more compatible.

01:39:37.477 --> 01:39:39.913
It translates the apps
when you install them,

01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:42.983
so they can launch immediately
and be instantly responsive.

01:39:43.417 --> 01:39:47.287
And Rosetta 2 can also
translate code on the fly when needed,

01:39:47.354 --> 01:39:51.258
like for web browsers with just-in-time
JavaScript compilers or for Java code.

01:39:51.625 --> 01:39:55.462
It even handles the most complex
Pro Apps and their plug-ins.

01:39:56.063 --> 01:40:00.200
Rosetta 2 is transparent to users,
and the performance is amazing.

01:39:56.063 --> 01:40:00.200
Rosetta 2 is transparent to users,
and the performance is amazing.

01:40:00.701 --> 01:40:05.005
We're also introducing new Virtualization
technologies in macOS Big Sur.

01:40:05.405 --> 01:40:08.575
So, for developers who wanna run
other environments like Linux

01:40:08.642 --> 01:40:11.378
or tools like Docker, we have you covered.

01:40:11.979 --> 01:40:14.181
When you put
all of these technologies together,

01:40:14.515 --> 01:40:17.718
Universal, Rosetta and Virtualization,

01:40:17.784 --> 01:40:21.021
you have a system that can run
an amazing diversity of apps.

01:40:21.688 --> 01:40:25.125
To show you how this all comes together,
I'll hand it over to Andreas Wendker.

01:40:28.228 --> 01:40:29.162
Thanks, Craig.

01:40:29.630 --> 01:40:32.432
Let's take a look at some existing apps
running under Rosetta.

01:40:32.499 --> 01:40:35.769
Rosetta, of course, works great with
all sorts of apps you use every day.

01:40:35.836 --> 01:40:39.206
But for our first demo, I'd like to
show you something a bit more challenging.

01:40:39.273 --> 01:40:42.309
This is Maya, the powerful animation
and modeling software

01:40:42.376 --> 01:40:44.011
running great here on Apple Silicon.

01:40:44.578 --> 01:40:48.182
I already have a model open that consists
of over six million polygons

01:40:48.248 --> 01:40:51.552
and, as you can see,
I can fluidly move around in this scene.

01:40:51.618 --> 01:40:54.888
So let's make it more challenging
and bring in textures and shaders as well.

01:40:55.689 --> 01:40:58.592
And still, everything is incredibly fluid.

01:40:59.259 --> 01:41:03.363
So Rosetta works great,
and the performance is simply fantastic.

01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:04.765
But Rosetta isn't just for apps.

01:41:04.831 --> 01:41:06.834
It also works amazingly well with games.

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:08.769
I can even use a game controller.

01:41:09.736 --> 01:41:11.405
This is Shadow of the Tomb Raider,

01:41:11.471 --> 01:41:14.775
a high-end AAA game
that's using our Metal APIs.

01:41:15.242 --> 01:41:17.377
I downloaded it directly from
the Mac App Store,

01:41:17.444 --> 01:41:19.079
so it's completely unmodified,

01:41:19.146 --> 01:41:20.814
and it is absolutely beautiful.

01:41:21.849 --> 01:41:23.350
Let me jump into the water.

01:41:24.351 --> 01:41:26.353
You can see
some of the lighting effects here.

01:41:30.858 --> 01:41:33.861
And as I follow the path,
you can see the game is responsive,

01:41:34.428 --> 01:41:35.495
it's smooth,

01:41:36.263 --> 01:41:39.666
and the best part is, you're running
the 1080p as a translated app

01:41:39.733 --> 01:41:41.268
and an emulation.

01:41:41.335 --> 01:41:43.437
So these new Macs, they are fast.

01:41:44.338 --> 01:41:46.540
You can see
some more of the lighting effects here.

01:41:47.341 --> 01:41:50.677
It's awesome what Rosetta can do
with existing games.

01:41:51.445 --> 01:41:54.982
Now, as Craig mentioned, many of our users
rely on apps from other environments.

01:41:55.048 --> 01:41:58.018
So let me bring up a Linux VM
in Parallels Desktop.

01:41:58.552 --> 01:42:01.522
You can see the graphical user interface
designed for Linux here.

01:42:01.588 --> 01:42:05.259
But, of course, many developers
like to use Linux for hosting servers.

01:42:05.325 --> 01:42:08.729
So let me dive down to the command line
and launch in Apache Web Server.

01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:11.865
And now I can simply bring up Safari

01:42:11.932 --> 01:42:15.402
and browse the website of the server
I just launched in the Linux VM.

01:42:15.469 --> 01:42:16.837
Here it is.

01:42:16.904 --> 01:42:19.706
Now I want to show you one more
type of app to run on these new Macs

01:42:19.773 --> 01:42:21.175
that we haven't even told you about yet,

01:42:21.241 --> 01:42:23.944
and that is iPhone and iPad apps.

01:42:24.011 --> 01:42:26.213
Since they've been built
to run on the same Apple Silicon

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.648
that we're using on our new Macs,

01:42:27.714 --> 01:42:29.917
they will run natively,
completely unmodified,

01:42:29.983 --> 01:42:31.418
on the new Macs as well.

01:42:31.485 --> 01:42:33.253
Let me show you a few.

01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.256
This here is one of my favorite games,
Monument Valley 2.

01:42:36.323 --> 01:42:38.225
It's fun to play here on the new Mac.

01:42:39.059 --> 01:42:42.162
And if I want to catch up on my
guitar lessons, I can use Fender Play.

01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:44.631
[guitar plays]

01:42:45.465 --> 01:42:47.868
Or if I want to relax
at the end of the day a little bit,

01:42:47.935 --> 01:42:49.403
I can bring up the Calm app.

01:42:51.338 --> 01:42:54.208
And that was just a quick look
at Rosetta, Virtualization

01:42:54.274 --> 01:42:57.945
and support for iPhone and iPad apps,
giving users amazing versatility

01:42:58.011 --> 01:43:01.448
for running apps and other environments
with macOS on Apple Silicon.

01:43:01.515 --> 01:43:02.583
Back to you, Craig.

01:43:04.518 --> 01:43:05.519
Thanks, Andreas.

01:43:05.919 --> 01:43:06.920
As you saw,

01:43:06.987 --> 01:43:11.758
Macs built with Apple Silicon will be able
to run iPhone and iPad apps directly.

01:43:12.292 --> 01:43:16.697
Starting day one, users can download
these apps right from the Mac App Store,

01:43:16.763 --> 01:43:20.400
and most apps will just work
with no changes from the developer.

01:43:21.068 --> 01:43:22.336
With everything we're doing,

01:43:22.402 --> 01:43:25.272
the range of apps that users
will be able to run on these new Macs

01:43:25.339 --> 01:43:27.474
is truly unprecedented.

01:43:27.541 --> 01:43:31.979
Together, we have all the technologies in
place to make this an amazing transition.

01:43:32.045 --> 01:43:33.547
The vast majority of Mac apps

01:43:33.614 --> 01:43:36.450
can be recompiled as Universal
in a few days,

01:43:36.517 --> 01:43:39.186
so users can have fast, native apps.

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:42.022
Rosetta 2 runs existing Mac apps,

01:43:42.489 --> 01:43:45.058
our Virtualization technology
makes it easier than ever

01:43:45.125 --> 01:43:47.694
to bring other environments,
like Linux, to the Mac,

01:43:47.761 --> 01:43:53.600
and Mac users can, for the first time,
run iOS and iPadOS apps directly,

01:43:53.667 --> 01:43:57.070
tapping into
the world's most vital app ecosystem.

01:43:57.137 --> 01:44:01.308
Now, we know our Mac developers will be
eager to get started on this new platform.

01:44:02.009 --> 01:44:05.979
So to get them going right away,
we're launching a Quick Start Program.

01:44:06.513 --> 01:44:07.981
The focus of the Quick Start Program

01:44:08.048 --> 01:44:10.617
is to enable developers
to make their apps Universal

01:44:10.684 --> 01:44:13.554
and take advantage
of all the capabilities of Apple Silicon.

01:44:14.121 --> 01:44:17.758
Developers will have access to
documentation and sample code,

01:44:17.824 --> 01:44:19.927
forums on developer.apple.com,

01:44:19.993 --> 01:44:24.998
priority DTS support incidents,
and access to labs around the world.

01:44:25.699 --> 01:44:29.469
This program also includes
new Developer Transition Kit hardware

01:44:29.536 --> 01:44:33.173
so developers can get going
even before we ship production systems.

01:44:33.607 --> 01:44:36.376
The DTK hardware
takes the form of a Mac mini,

01:44:36.443 --> 01:44:39.513
but one with an A12Z SoC inside.

01:44:39.847 --> 01:44:43.283
It has desktop specs,
including 16 gigabytes of memory,

01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:48.155
a 512-gig SSD,
and a complement of Mac I/O ports.

01:44:48.522 --> 01:44:50.290
Most significantly, it will include

01:44:50.357 --> 01:44:54.361
the macOS Big Sur developer beta
and Xcode tools.

01:44:54.428 --> 01:44:56.597
Developers will be able to apply
to the program

01:44:56.663 --> 01:44:59.700
at developer.apple.com today.

01:44:59.967 --> 01:45:02.569
We will be shipping units out
starting this week

01:45:02.636 --> 01:45:04.438
so you can get to work.

01:45:05.138 --> 01:45:08.175
So that's how macOS Big Sur
is paving the way

01:45:08.242 --> 01:45:11.078
for a smooth transition to Apple Silicon.

01:45:11.478 --> 01:45:14.581
This year, we're elevating the Mac
to a whole new level.

01:45:14.648 --> 01:45:16.917
And it's an incredible opportunity
for developers.

01:45:17.584 --> 01:45:20.053
I can't wait to see what you all create,

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:24.324
and I can't wait until
we can all be together in person again.

01:45:24.391 --> 01:45:26.059
And now, back to Tim.

01:45:28.295 --> 01:45:30.497
Thank you, Craig, and thank you, Johny.

01:45:30.564 --> 01:45:33.467
It truly is a historic day for the Mac.

01:45:34.368 --> 01:45:36.537
Our vision for the Mac
has always been about

01:45:36.603 --> 01:45:39.373
embracing breakthrough innovation
and having the courage

01:45:39.439 --> 01:45:41.308
to make bold changes.

01:45:41.375 --> 01:45:45.012
Every time we've done this, the Mac
has come out stronger and more capable.

01:45:45.512 --> 01:45:47.080
And I have never been more confident

01:45:47.147 --> 01:45:49.416
about the future of the Mac
than I am today.

01:45:50.317 --> 01:45:52.719
So, what's the timeline
for this transition?

01:45:52.786 --> 01:45:53.787
Well, for developers,

01:45:53.854 --> 01:45:56.423
it begins this week with
the valuable information

01:45:56.490 --> 01:46:01.028
delivered at this conference as well as
applying for the Quick Start Program.

01:46:01.094 --> 01:46:02.095
And for the customers,

01:46:02.162 --> 01:46:06.166
we expect to ship our first Mac with
Apple Silicon by the end of this year,

01:46:06.233 --> 01:46:09.269
and we expect the transition
to take about two years.

01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:13.440
We plan to continue to support and release
new versions of macOS

01:46:13.507 --> 01:46:16.243
for Intel-based Macs for years to come.

01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:20.080
In fact, we have some new Intel-based Macs
in the pipeline

01:46:20.147 --> 01:46:21.648
that we're really excited about.

01:46:22.916 --> 01:46:26.353
What a huge leap forward for the Mac
and for Apple.

01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:29.189
Apple Silicon will bring
amazing technologies,

01:46:29.256 --> 01:46:30.858
industry-leading performance,

01:46:30.924 --> 01:46:33.861
and a common architecture
across all of our products.

01:46:34.995 --> 01:46:37.464
What an incredible day of announcements.

01:46:37.531 --> 01:46:40.033
As you've seen,
we haven't stopped innovating.

01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:43.937
We pushed all of our platforms forward
in some amazing new ways.

01:46:44.738 --> 01:46:48.809
Our OS releases will be available
as developer betas today.

01:46:49.843 --> 01:46:54.715
And each of them will have a public beta,
including watchOS for the very first time,

01:46:54.781 --> 01:46:56.183
starting next month.

01:46:57.284 --> 01:47:01.355
And all of this great software will be
available to our customers this fall.

01:47:02.656 --> 01:47:05.325
We hope you've enjoyed
this very special keynote

01:47:05.392 --> 01:47:08.262
and that you're ready
for the big week ahead,

01:47:08.328 --> 01:47:11.298
with over 100
engineering-led video sessions,

01:47:11.365 --> 01:47:13.834
one-on-one consultations
with Apple engineers,

01:47:13.901 --> 01:47:15.402
and so much more.

01:47:16.036 --> 01:47:18.705
We can't wait
to start working with all of you

01:47:18.772 --> 01:47:21.208
and watch you do
the best work of your lives.

01:47:22.276 --> 01:47:24.678
At Apple, we've always drawn strength

01:47:24.745 --> 01:47:27.014
from the diversity of our global community

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:30.017
because we truly believe
when we all work together,

01:47:30.083 --> 01:47:31.919
we can change the world for the better.

01:47:32.486 --> 01:47:34.821
Thanks to you all for joining us.

01:47:34.888 --> 01:47:36.657
This has been such a big day,

01:47:36.723 --> 01:47:39.660
and it's only the beginning
of a huge week to come.

01:47:39.726 --> 01:47:42.329
So let's have a great WWDC.

01:47:43.330 --> 01:47:45.832
